More people here than at the FD run.

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,580
The race between Takumi and
Nakazato is getting a lot of attention.

31
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,926
What am I gonna do'! I'm getting
more depressed by the minute.

32
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,126
We are in no position to say it was a mistake.

33
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,565
Takumi!

34
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,786
Please show up!

35
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:24,473

<i>Where the hell are you?!</i>

38
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,103
Could you win if it were you'!

39
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:43,485
Yeah. I'd win against any
car I raced, R32 or not.

40
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:48,665
Do you think... I can win'!

41
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,769
I know it wasn't your decision to take this race.

42
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,073
Trust me. Whatever you do,
don't race that R32.

43
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,278
You hear me'!

44
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,047
Since your opponent's driving an R32,

45
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,215
no one would call you
a coward for backing out.

46
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,216
<i>A coward?!</i>

47
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,026
--Wow!
--Here they come.

48
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,489
--The Night Kids!
--It's Nakazato': R32!

49
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,778
It's amazing!

50
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:37,059
The black R32 is like a champion of the street.

51
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,453
So these are the Night Kids.

52
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,746
They sure came in with a big group!

53
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:50,796
<i>K... Keyfm</i>

54
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:53,298
We'd better start apologizing soon.

55
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,767
<i>Well... but...</i>

56
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,768
There's still time before 10:00.

57
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,273
Let's go talk him into it.

58
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,541
"What?
"What?

59
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,244
I don't think it's such a good idea

60
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,245
to drag Takumi into a losing battle.

61
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,048
We'll never know until they actually race.

62
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,386
Of course he'll lose.

63
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,922
It's obvious if you're thinking clearly!

64
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,724
He's going to race the R32!

65
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:21,725
He can't match its power,
and it's got 4WD ATTESA E-TS!

66
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:26,229
I thought the same at first.

67
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,033
But since I've been here, I've started
thinking there may be a chance.

68
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,237
Of course, if this was the circuit,
the Eight-Six couldn't win.

69
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,375
But this is a mountain pass!

70
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,878
This is the pass Takumi has been
running for the last five years.

71
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,216
Nobody knows what's going to happen.

72
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,152
When Takumi drives the Eight-Six,

73
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,152
it's no longer an ordinary Eight-Six.

74
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:52,422
It turns into a super machine
with infinite fighting power!

75
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:56,092
I know, because I have been
in the car when he's driving...

76
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:01,164
Takumi': driving is far better
than anything we've ever imagined.

77
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,669
You mean that time when you fainted
after three corners down the hill

78
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,042
with your death wails
echoing through Mt. Akina.

79
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:13,443
His downhill driving is that crazy!

80
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,547
There should be one other
person who feels the same way.

81
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:21,351
Wh... Who is that'!

82
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,055
There is one other person who
got a good look at his driving.

83
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,261
Are... Are you trying to say...'!

84
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,261
That's right!

85
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:34,054
KeisukeTakahashi of the Red Suns!

86
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,938
Here come the Takahashi Brothers!

87
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,659
--Now we have more stars!
--It's so exciting!

88
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,279
Keisuke!

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,980
My dear Ryosuke!

90
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,450
You look great!

91
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,451
They have groupie: now 'cause they're cool.

92
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,507
Damn it! Racers should be
admired for their skills.

93
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,229
--I'm no match for them either way.
--I'm no match for them either way.

94
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,230
On top of that, they're rich.

95
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,039
I knew they would be here!

96
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,728
I'm looking forward to seeing

97
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,364
how this race turns out.

98
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,799
Watch closely!

99
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,800
I'll show you who the fastest man in Gunma is!

100
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,471
Not the Eight-Six or the Takahashi Brothers...

101
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:49,472
It's me! Takeshi Nakazato of the Night Kids!

102
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,211
Bastard!

103
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,212
Looks like the Eight-Six isn't here yet.

104
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,483
In that case,

105
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,884
we have to persuade Takumi no matter what.

106
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,221
All right...

107
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,658
Getin!

108
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,838
Itsuki! What's wrong'!

109
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:16,065
I'll... stay, lketani...

110
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,502
I can't face Takumi...

111
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,208
Okay.

112
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,509
Wait here until the last possible minute, ltsuki!

113
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,560
I'll bring him, no matter what!

114
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,784
<i>Pm sure that Takumi is coming.</i>

115
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,022
<i>But still...</i>

116
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,013
--Ryosuke! Dear Keisuke!
"What a nice <i>place</i> I'm in!

117
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,743
I might make a habit of this!

118
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,191
Ryosuke!Wait!

119
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,416
Ryosuke, honey!

120
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:04,514
<i>What': going on? Pm so tense I could die.</i>

121
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,485
<i>I wanna go to Mt. Akina so bad.</i>

122
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:14,319
<i>Pm not really sure if I love
driving that much, but...</i>

123
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:19,529
<i>For the past five years, come rain or snow,</i>

124
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,834
<i>I've driven Mt. Akina more often than anyone.</i>

125
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,771
<i>I want to see how much Pm capable of.</i>

126
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:33,678
<i>Everyone says that the GT-R is really fast,</i>

127
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,679
<i>so I want to challenge it
with everything I've got.</i>

128
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,550
<i>I've never felt like this before.</i>

129
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,089
<i>I can'! stop thinking about racing,
even though I don't have a car.</i>

130
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,130
<i>On the contrary, I want to
race more every second.</i>

131
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,433
My Stupid dad!

132
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,804
Where the hell did you go'!

133
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
Oh!

134
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,378
Takumi!

135
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,247
Iketani!

136
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,187
What?!

137
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,188
Your father has taken the car?

138
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,594
<i>Yeah...</i>

139
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:25,564
You have no idea where he might be'!

140
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,565
I thought he might be at some bar,

141
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,103
and I called every bar I know.

142
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,172
You couldn't find him'!

143
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,774
<i>Uh-uh...</i>

144
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,510
What the hell...'!!

145
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,510
If you don't have the Eight-Six,
there's no use talking about it.

146
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,780
This is really unexpected.

147
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,350
Iketani, did you come here
to talk me into racing?

148
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,222
Kind of, yeah.

149
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,625
People are making a big
deal over this at the pass!

150
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:55,561
Nakazato of the Night Kids

151
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,561
and the Takahashi Brothers
are stirring up the crowd.

152
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,065
But despite all that...
you are the star today, Takumi!

153
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,535
Wait a minute! Please...

154
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,406
...don't give me a hard time.

155
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,407
Still... you haven't changed your mind'!

156
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,612
It's not that.

157
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,613
To tell you the truth, I wanted to go.

158
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,484
"What?!
"What?!

159
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,484
But without the car, what can I do'!

160
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,489
I was very depressed until you arrived.

161
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,893
Gee! Why is this happening?

162
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,629
How disappointing!

163
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,630
What can we do without the car'!

164
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,234
I've got an idea! Hey, Takumi.

165
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:38,903
How about running in Kenji': 180'!

166
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,272
Great idea!

167
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,906
It's the same FR...

168
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:44,109
<i>...and</i> it's got turbo for extra power...

169
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,745
It sure will run fast if you drive it.

170
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,746
--It won't work.
--Why not'!

171
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,349
I'm not gonna race in somebody else': car.

172
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:57,086
It's gotta be my own car that I'm used to.

173
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,525
You have a point.

174
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:03,028
Driving somebody else': car

175
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,029
is not a good thing in the racing world.

176
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:09,298
Anyway, I'll wait until the last minute.

177
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,675
That's my only option.

178
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,055
He's late.What's going on'!

179
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,414
It's already 9:45.

180
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,415
I guess he's not coming.

181
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,954
Where is he'!

182
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,589
--What time is it'!
"Almost 10:00.

183
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,125
Oh, no! He's not gonna make it!

184
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,461
<i>Where are you, Dad?</i>

185
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,897
<i>Please come back!</i>

186
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,978
<i>I don'! have any more time!</i>

187
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,313
--He's back!
"What?

188
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,282
Turning off of the highway...

189
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:00,353
...gunning the engine twice,
that rhythm... and that roar...

190
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,188
He's here.

191
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,039
You can tell that just from the exhaust sound'!

192
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,441
Are you sure it's your car'!

193
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,072
Of course I am. It's absolutely my car!

194
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:31,816
The Takahashi Brothers are here.

195
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:32,984
<i>Yeah...</i>

196
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,125
They must be very anxious about this race.

197
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,579
They told me to my face that I'd lose.

198
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,596
Damn RyosukeTakahashi!

199
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,597
He's not as good as his reputation suggests.

200
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,269
I'll beat the Eight-Six right in front of him

201
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,471
and embarrass him.

202
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,173
Let's do it.

203
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,174
And if you show that you're
faster than the Eight-Six

204
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,613
that beat Keisuke Takahashi...

205
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,614
...we can prove that we're
faster than the Red Suns.

206
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,885
This is a good opportunity to
make the crowd realize something.

207
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,857
The drift run can never beat the grip run.

208
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,729
There you go! It's like your favorite phrase.

209
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,567
It's a matter of course.

210
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,568
The drift run is just a
performance to rile up the crowd.

211
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:28,573
It's not a technique for driving fast.

212
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,574
It's just like you to say it firmly.

213
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,546
I can say this, 'cause I went
through a drift stage myself

214
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,547
when I was driving the S13.

215
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,583
A racer who has outgrown the
drift run can drive the fastest

216
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,454
in the grip run.

217
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,889
When you lost to the R32,

218
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,890
it was really shocking.

219
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:50,893
Oops! That was a no-no.

220
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,063
Well... I've changed since then.

221
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,402
Since that monster defeated me,

222
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,403
I'm driving better than ever before in the R32.

223
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,340
You can't call yourself a street
racer if you stop pursuing races.

224
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,944
I can't stand everyone making such
a fuss about the drift technique.

225
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,917
Come out, Eight-Six!

226
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,918
Showing off by drifting in your FR is over.

227
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,591
I'll prove it!

228
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,592
As usual, he doesn't show up
until the last minute.

229
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,231
I wonder if he'll really show up.

230
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:29,033
Didn't he tell you he had
no intention of coming'!

231
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:32,034
He's coming.

232
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,372
I'm sure of it.

233
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,453
He'll definitely come.

234
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,316
Anyway, that's the story.

235
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,652
So I'm taking the car, Dad!

236
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,721
You'd better hurry, Takumi!

237
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,990
It's almost time.

238
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,759
We're sorry... We're taking Takumi with us.

239
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,729
We'll buy ten of your deep-fried
tofu in return when we get back.

240
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,780
Th-The ones mixed with veggies, too...

241
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,819
Hey!wait!

242
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,010
<i>Takumi...</i>

243
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,379
<i>His eyes looked different.</i>

244
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,400
<i>What': going on?</i>

245
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,386
<i>Never mind.</i>

246
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,577
<i>With that setting, he'll do a good job.</i>

247
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,030
We're almost at the pass.

248
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,932
I wonder if you can catch up.

249
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,034
Sorry to disappoint you,

250
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,202
but his car is a non-turbo 1.6.

251
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:40,872
This is a Z-liter turbo.

252
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,207
Whatever the case may be going downhill,

253
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,476
it's no joke if I fall far behind him going uphill.

254
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:50,137
Who do you think I am?! One of
the top three in the Speed Stars.

255
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,193
Wow,

256
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,161
So fast!

257
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,882
I can do that, too.

258
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,505
To full power!

259
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,573
--Oh...!
--Oh...!

260
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,741
HE'S gone!

261
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,172
The Eight-Six has disappeared!

262
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,883
<i>Takumi... You were looking away
even during the entrance ceremony.</i>

263
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:45,027
Two minutes to 10:00.

264
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,770
<i>I guess they couldn't talk him into it.</i>

265
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:02,184
<i>I should go apologize like a real man.</i>

266
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:09,158
<i>Wait! lketani told me to wait.</i>

267
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,538
<i>I should do as I was told.</i>

268
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,671
<i>But this is all my fault.</i>

269
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,374
<i>Nothing to do with the Speed Stars.</i>

270
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,305
<i>I should take my punishment like a man.</i>

271
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,621
<i>Oh, no! There are so many of them!</i>

272
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,252
<i>Looks like I have to roll with the punches.</i>

273
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,795
<i>This is no joke!</i>

274
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,267
<i>I doubt they'll be willing to forgive me</i>

275
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:52,048
<i>if! tell them the Eight-Six isn't coming now.</i>

276
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,414
<i>Apologizing on my knees won'! help.</i>

277
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,415
<i>If worse comes to worst, I might get killed.</i>

278
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,154
<i>Dad! Mom!</i>

279
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,555
<i>Help me!</i>

280
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,591
<i>Please, God!</i>

281
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,992
<i>I haven'! even done it with a girl yet.</i>

282
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,995
<i>I don'! wanna die a virgin.</i>

283
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,597
--It's him!
--He's here!

284
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,598
<i>Oh, no! They found me!</i>

285
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:26,170
It's too late to run.

286
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,171
<i>Pm dead!</i>

287
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,124
What the hell are you doing

288
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,860
sitting in the middle of the road, ltsuki'!

289
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,629
<i>Ta... Ta... Ta...</i>

290
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,098
Get out of my way!

291
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:56,098
Come on! I'm gonna run you over.

292
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,070
Takumi!

293
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,305
You came!

294
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,674
<i>Yeah...</i>

295
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,674
Sorry, ltsuki... for being late.

296
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:08,811
Takumi...!

297
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,814
A street racer should race
if he's challenged, right'!

298
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,232
Takumi...!

299
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,923
Don't...Your snot... Hey, stop, ltsuki!

300
00:19:22,761 --> 00:19:25,601
Yeah... That's the spirit!

301
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,171
Hello, this is Fujiwara Tofu.

302
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,172
Oh,Yuichi!

303
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,376
Are you there?

304
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:41,245
I wonder what happened to my son.

305
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,246
He wanted to go to the pass of his own accord.

306
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,118
Like father, like son, huh'!

307
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,119
Putting that aside,
today his opponent is a GT-R.

308
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,124
Honestly, does he have a chance?

309
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,426
He really did show up.

310
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,427
Keisuke, you were right.

311
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,965
So it seems...

312
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,034
You were gonna tell that Eight-Six': driver

313
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,035
about the R32': weak point, weren't you'!

314
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,073
I was, but not anymore.

315
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,074
Once I saw his face, I felt nothing but disgust.

316
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,678
He's my enemy, after all. Besides...

317
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:22,470
...he won't lose, even if he doesn't
know the R32': weak point.

318
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,157
Did you give him any advice?

319
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:29,158
Nothing special, but even
the GT-R has a weak point.

320
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,398
<i>The R32's weak point is...</i>

321
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,301
<i>Put simply... the</i> body <i>weight...</i>

322
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,302
...the understeer resulting
from being super front-heavy.

323
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,674
Even with a tuned pedal
and driving technique,

324
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,743
this basic fact doesn't change.

325
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,746
If you keep driving tough on the downhill,

326
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,746
the front tires and brakes
will wear out for sure.

327
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,749
Even with a tuned brake,

328
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,087
by the time they come
to the bottom of the hill,

329
00:20:56,088 --> 00:21:00,368
it'll have trouble with the
understeer going into the turn.

330
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,630
If there is any chance of winning,

331
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,741
it's in the corners towards
the end of the course.

332
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,201
Whether or not the Eight-Six can
keep up with the R32 until then...

333
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:15,873
That's the key to this race.

334
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,076
About the Eight-Six': foot settings...

335
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,944
I changed the settings a little bit.

336
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,605
The foot settings? How'!

337
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,386
So that it will heavily understeer
when you step on the gas pedal.

338
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,554
That's how the foot setting is now.

339
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,555
What?! Understeer by
punching the accelerator?!

340
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,726
Takumi': driving uses drift.

341
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,728
What were you thinking, Bunta'!

342
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:40,729
How can he race with that
foot setting against the GT-R'!

343
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:43,634
You don't understand, Yuichi.

344
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,003
If you are good enough,

345
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:48,003
the understeer setting allows you
to accelerate faster when it's FR.

346
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:50,441
For the purpose of carrying tofu,

347
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:53,442
it's usually set lower.

348
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,681
With this setting,

349
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:59,312
it's possible to drive longer at full power.

350
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,229
But only if you're good enough...

351
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,450
I'm sure he can handle it.

352
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,497
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

353

<i>'Cuz Pm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

360

382
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:29,598
<i>Mr. Nakazato, what is your chance
of winning against the Eight-Six?</i>

383
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,435
<i>Can'! you tell without asking?</i>

384
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:34,436
<i>You mean your R32': going to win.
But Ryosuke Takahashi said...</i>

385
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:37,208
<i>He's just a coward since his brother lost!</i>

386
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,209
<i>I will teach them that I, Takeshi
Nakazato, am the fastest in Gunma.</i>

387
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:44,379
<i>I'll show them once and for all that
grip driving is better than drifting!</i>

388

<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
