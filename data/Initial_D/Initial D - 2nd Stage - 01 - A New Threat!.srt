"An amazing downhill specialist
came out ofAkina's mountain passes.

19
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,064
Driving his cherished Eight-Six,
this young genius stunned all

20
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,632
with his amazing drift technique.

21
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,867
Since the beginning of junior high school,

22
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:44,136
Takumi has been driving
through the mountain passes

23
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,038
making deliveries for his family's tofu store.

24
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,439
It was all part of his father Bunta': plan

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,441
to nurture Takumi': talent
and make him a racing genius.

26
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,076
Driving every day, through rain and snow,

27
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,445
he gradually acquired and
perfected his remarkable skills.

28
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,447
He emerged as a hero and
the fastest man in Gunma,

29
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,883
and all the racers in the area
started to challenge him.

30
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,085
Takumi improved with every race...

31
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,421
His driving amazed the spectators
and captured their hearts.

32
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,656
In the end, he even defeated
the great Ryosuke Takahashi,

33
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:06,658
and the glorious legend of the
invincible downhill racer was born.

34
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,427
But there was no rest for
this warrior of the road.

35
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,568
There were more battles ahead
for this fastest downhill racer."

36
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:38,561
Darn it! There's no way I'll let
an outsider mess with me!

37
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,597
This is a piece of cake.

38
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:28,573
Whoa!

39
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,614
--He passed him!
--Oh, no! That Evo IV is fast!

40
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,709
Darn it!

"Act 1: A New Threat"

42
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,986
It's just like what fighter pilots used to do

43
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:16,755
when they shot down other fighters.

44
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,806
Quite fancy, isn't it'!

45
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,226
In a month, we, Team Emperor, will rule Gunma.

46
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:28,134
Ian-Evo drivers are the true
kings of the mountain passes.

47
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,020
--Hey, Takumi.
--Yeah'!

48
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,689
As I get used to it, I really think

49
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,690
that my Eight-Five is
pathetically slow on the uphill.

50
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,762
I want more power.

51
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,063
Really?

52
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,064
I've secretly been thinking of adding
a turbocharger to my Eight-Five

53
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,203
and turning it into a super-fast car!

54
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,204
Turbo? Can you add that now'!

55
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,408
Isn't it supposed to come
with the car when you buy it'!

56
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,844
I know. But there's this thing
called a "bolt-on turbo."

57
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,549
You can add it later if you want to.

58
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:20,550
Turbo is the easiest way to add
power to your car, isn't it'!

59
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:24,187
Imagine my Eight-Five with a turbocharger...

60
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,324
...going as fast as drivers
in an S13 or One-Eighty...

61
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,094
...on a straight course!

62
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,265
I bet everyone would be stunned!

63
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,739
Just thinking about it is exciting! Hooray!

64
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,609
Move over, ltsuki. Someone':
coming up really fast.

65
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,678
<i>What...'!</i>

66
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,579
Hey! The other way!

67
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,894
"That's a Ian-Evo!
--A Ian-Evo'!

68
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,229
<i>What': up with that car?
What a strange movement!</i>

69
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,131
Did you see that insane acceleration?!

70
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,670
--Yeah.
--The engine is only 2000 cc...

71
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,472
...but it's got 280 horsepower.

72
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:17,073
That's the power of turbo.
It's also got four-wheel drive.

73
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,045
<i>I see. That movement comes
from the four-wheel drive.</i>

74
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:27,896
<i>Four tires can handle power that two tires can't.</i>

75
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,594
My Evo IV is so beautiful
that it gives me chills.

76
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,532
This is an example

77
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,533
of what the pursuit of perfect
driving functionality leads to.

78
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,103
It's like the body of a well-trained boxer.

79
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,510
The air ducts on the front...

80
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,845
Protruding blister packing...

81
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,414
The oversized rear wing...

82
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:58,216
They all have their purpose.

83
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,217
The Ian-Evo was developed and perfected

84
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,990
to win world-class rally tournaments.

85
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,991
High-powered turbo and four-wheel drive.

86
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,661
A car isn't complete without them.

87
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:15,365
The Ian-Evo is the fastest street racer.

88
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:20,855
Hey, Kyoichi. Let's finish
all the FR punks in Gunma.

89
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,417
That Ian-Evo is here.

90
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,052
I don't like this.

91
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:35,821
Do you think they're from some racing team'!

92
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,389
Don't worry about them.

93
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,192
I'm gonna get some coffee.You want some'!

94
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,503
Oh, me, too! Please!

95
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,653
He's coming this way!

96
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:58,676
Hey!

97
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,447
I need directions.

98
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,438
Uh, okay!

99
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,555
This route is much shorter.

100
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,190
I see.Thanks a lot.

101
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,060
By the way, let me ask you something.

102
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,061
Who's the fastest driver here in Akina'!

103
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,632
The fastest?

104
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,633
Did you by any chance come here
to challenge the Eight-Six'!

105
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:28,137
What, us'! Challenging an Eight-Six'!

106
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,078
Your face is enough of a joke, Levin boy.

107
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,182
Defeating an Eight-Six
will not impress anyone.

108
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,418
Worse than that.

109
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,609
My teammates would laugh at me
if I bragged about such a thing.

110
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,690
Anyone driving a junker like
an Eight-Six is beneath me!

111
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:51,097
I wouldn't race them even if they asked.

112
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:57,267
You shouldn't talk like that...

113
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,172
...when you've never even
seen Akina': Eight-Six!

114
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,173
Akina': Eight-Six has never lost!

115
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,978
Not to an FC! Not to an FD...

116
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,847
...not even to an R32!

117
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,848
Oh, really? They all must have
been really bad drivers, then.

118
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:15,652
Not at all! They were all the
top drivers in this prefecture!

119
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:16,955
Oh, no!

120
00:09:16,956 --> 00:09:19,956
The top'! It's pretty low-level
here in Gunma, isn't it'!

121
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,494
What did you just say?!

122
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,962
Stop it, ltsuki!

123
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,530
You, too, Seiji.

124
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,531
You don't have to talk like that.
We didn't come here to pick fights.

125
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,902
Sorry, guys. My buddy here has a big mouth.

126
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,139
No problem.

127
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,074
I'll just say this so you won't misunderstand.

128
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,076
We don't mean to insult that Eight-Six driver.

129
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,645
I am sure his technique is great.

130
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,414
But the car...

131
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,415
I'd have to say the Eight-Six
is no longer good enough.

132
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,987
He's right! Tell that to the driver.

133
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,690
And tell him that we might let him race us

134
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,225
if he drives a more powerful car.

135
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,062
But we will never lose.

136
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,433
<i>The king of mountain passes is the Len-Eve!</i>

137
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,178
Darn! Hey,Takumi!

138
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,179
Aren't you mad at all after all that talk?!

139
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,783
Yeah, I was pretty angry.

140
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,553
So why didn't you say anything?!

141
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,554
Watching you get furious...

142
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,425
...somehow calmed me down.

143
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,761
What the heck is up with that'!

144
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,762
Besides, there have been guys
who talked like that before, right'!

145
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,799
--Right...
--Arguing with them doesn't do any good.

146
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,470
You can't really tell who's faster
unless you actually race.

147
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,408
I see your point.

148
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,409
But I can't just stand there when
someone insults the Eight-Six like that!

149
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Because I've always admired the Eight-Six.

150
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,618
I know the Eight-Six is an old model.

151
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,639
It's got no turbo, and it's slow on the uphill.

152
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,158
But in the true fan's mind,

153
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,159
the Eight-Six is faster than any other car!

154
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,032
Hey, stop crying. Here you go.

155
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:08,533
What'!

156
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,902
Drink your coffee.

157
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,363
Thanks.

158
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,009
Hey, Takumi.You can do it, right'!

159
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,211
You can beat the Ian-Evo on a downhill,

160
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,681
and crush the ego of that
cocky long-haired guy!

161
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,782
I don't know. He said he
wouldn't race the Eight-Six.

162
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,623
--I've got it... The turbo!
"What?

163
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,054
If we added turbo to the Eight-Six,
it would be amazing,Takumi!

164
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,112
This Ian-Evojerk certainly sounds obnoxious.

165
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,917
Yeah. I was so furious!

166
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,918
I wonder if they're the guys who
came to challenge Thunder Fire'!

167
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,055
They're members of a team
called Emperor or something.

168
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:09,992
I heard they're from Nikko
and they only drive Ian-Evos,

169
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,830
and that they're extremely cocky,
but they drive very fast.

170
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,401
I heard they beat Thunder Fire into the ground.

171
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:20,872
I heard about that, too.

172
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:23,873
They supposedly said that
they wanted to rule Gunma,

173
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:27,076
so they might show up in Akina.

174
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,446
Are you serious?!

175
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,915
I wonder if they were checking
out the area yesterday?

176
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,418
The Ian-Evo will be really hard to beat...

177
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,419
...even for Ta ku m I's Eig ht-S ix.

178
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:39,057
Thank you very much!

179
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,459
Anyway, putting these guys aside,

180
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,460
we never know when or who
he'll be racing from now on.

181
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,033
So because of that,

182
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:52,034
we definitely need to beef up his Eight-Six.

183
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,305
Right?! Right?!

184
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,641
That's what I'm talking about!

185
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,110
Adding turbo to the Eight-Six.

186
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,478
That's a good idea!

187
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,914
I mean, good for ltsuki.

188
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,915
It might be easier for him to just
switch to a faster car, of course.

189
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,687
But I just can't imagine him driving
anything other than the Eight-Six.

190
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,526
Yeah.We want him to stick to the Eight-Six.

191
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:18,496
You're both so right!

192
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,497
The coolest part is that he drives
the Eight-Six and he's darn fast!

193
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,003
Takumi, give it some thought.

194
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,405
I don't know...

195
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:30,041
It's my father's car, you know.

196
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,210
That's right, I forgot...

197
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,211
Can't we somehow convince your father?

198
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:39,015
I've got it! If we told him
we'd pay for everything,

199
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,119
I bet he wouldn't object!

200
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,120
You're right! I bet he'd love
having his car souped up!

201
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,293
How about it,Takumi'!!

202
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,294
If the car were more powerful,
its fuel economy would suffer, right'!

203
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,464
Yeah, sort of.

204
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,066
Then we've got no chance.

205
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,527
Because my dad is stingy as hell.

206
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:02,140
Don't say things like that
to spoil our image of him!

207
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:05,141
Your dad is our idol, you know!

208
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,178
What?! That man is your idol'!

209
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,017
<i>Hey..-</i>

210
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,887
You shouldn't waste time
trying to convince him.

211
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,055
We should just go ahead

212
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:20,056
with the "Akina Eight-Six
Power-Up Project" ourselves!

213
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,653
Right! Let's do it!

214
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,960
Long time no see, Ryosuke.

215
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,001
Kyoichi Sudo. I thought it was you.

216
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,469
What are you up to'!

217
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,738
Easy, now! You should be nicer,

218
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,674
seeing as how we haven't
seen each other in over a year.

219
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,675
We're bored because we don't have
anyone to play with in our hood.

220
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,379
So we came looking for some
high-spirited playmates, that's all.

221
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,082
Since this will be our playground,

222
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,686
we thought we'd say hi
to the people here today.

223
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,523
How considerate of you. Do as you wish.

224
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,094
But here in Akagi,

225
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:33,095
the playtime won't be as fun as you think...

226
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,432
...as long as our team, the Red Suns, is here.

227
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,104
You'rejust as proud as I remember.

228
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,440
But don't forget this...

229
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,901
I'm not the same person I was a year ago.

230
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,050
You beat me last time, but now it's my turn!

231
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,852
Just as you broke my perfect winning record,

232
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:57,923
I will now break your winning streak!

233
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:02,393
I'm sorry to tell you, but my streak...

234
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,529
...was broken recently.

235
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,230
What'!

236
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,231
I lost to an Eight-Six on a
downhill course in Akina.

237
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,902
What did you say?!

238
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,904
I was considering retiring,

239
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,840
but I don't want you to
think that I'm running away.

240
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:18,841
So maybe I'll agree to a rematch
and race you once more.

241
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,645
And I admire your enthusiasm
in coming all the way here.

242
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:24,415
I'll speak to the other teams

243
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,417
and arrange for the course in Akagi

244
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,418
to be free for three days before the race.

245
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,989
Drive as much as you want and get used to it.

246
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,245
I'll race you whenever you're ready, Kyoichi.

247
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:45,901
What a jerk, acting all cool like that!
I'll chase him down and tailgate him!

248
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,905
Don't, Seiji.You can't.
You won't be able to catch him.

249
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,710
I won't? Such a skinny, frail guy!

250
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,711
He doesn't look that tough at all.
And that outdated FC...

251
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,183
He even lost to an Eight-Six, right'!

252
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:02,184
You idiot! Don't underestimate
RyosukeTakahashi!

253
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:06,938
I was solidly defeated by his FC last year!

254
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,962
<i>The White Comet of Akagi...</i>

255
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,963
<i>I thought I was the only
one who could beat him...</i>

256
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:19,814
<i>Bu! Ryosuke lost?
He lost to an Eight-Six from Akina?</i>

257
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:25,141
Akina': Eight-Six has never lost to anyone!

258
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,912
Not to an FC! Not to an FD...

259
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,348
...not even to an R32!

260
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,349
<i>I see. That kid was talking
about that same Eight-Six.</i>

261
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,542
<i>I wonder what the driver': like?</i>

262
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,371
Guess who'!

263
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,422
Cut it out, Mogi.

264
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:59,944
I'm actually relieved.

265
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,945
I don't know what I would have done
if you had said some other girl's name.

266
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,930
<i>Silly...</i>

267
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:16,332
Hey, Takumi, let's go home.

268
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:21,165
Oh, maybe I'll go home alone.

269
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,835
After all, I am the lonely driver.

270
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,636
Yeah. So, I should go home alone...

271
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,637
--The "Eight-Six Power-Up Project." --What are
you talking about? We have to work today.

272
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,911
I have something to do, too.

273
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,813
Okay.

274
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,381
See you, Takumi. Bye!

275
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,917
Bye.

276
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,153
So, Takumi...

277
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:44,822
...how far have you two gone since then'!

278
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:45,990
How fa r'!

279
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,391
Oh, come on!

280
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,392
You and Natsuki! Have you
gone farther than kissing?

281
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,265
Come on, tell me! Whoops!

282
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,825
This is a one-race match.
It'll be decided by a hill climb.

283
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,297
--Fine.
--Shall we begin, then'!

284
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:29,033
Are you ready, Seiji'!

285
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,904
Anytime!

286
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,007
<i>Don'! mess this upJakeshi.</i>

287
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,876
<i>Show them the willpower of Gunma drivers!</i>

288
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,877
<i>Just for today, H! root for you!</i>

289
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,682
<i>Our goal is much more than this race.</i>

290
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,683
<i>Seiji, don'! waste time goofing around here.</i>

291
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,921
Five seconds to the start!

292
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,323
<i>Four... Three...</i>

293
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,425
<i>Two... One...</i>

294
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:55,946
Gog

295
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,569
<i>Wait and see.</i>

296
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,570
<i>Compared to a Ian-Evo, an R32 is just a toy.</i>

297
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,928
I'll show you the difference!

298
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,084
<i>You Emperor punks,
or whatever you call yourselves...</i>

299
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,820
<i>...I will defend Gunma!</i>

300
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,741
<i>And you'll be buried deep
at the bottom of Myogi Valley!</i>

301
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,378
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

302
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,283
<i>There was always that
unchanging smile of yours</i>

303
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,554
<i>It was there on days when
I was too tired to go on</i>

304
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,226
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

305
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,035
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

306
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,850
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

307
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,719
<i>The warm wind</i>

308
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,859
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

309
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,534
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

310
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,542
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

311
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,782
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

312
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:48,390
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

313
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,380
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>
