00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,188
They didn't need you on a Sunday afternoon?

27
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,458
Maybe you aren't that useful.

28
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,395
How rude!

29
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,198
It was super busy in the morning.

30
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,199
I've worked two weeks straight,
so they gave me an afternoon off.

31
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,073
That's okay,then.

32
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,908
Why did you come here, anyway?

33
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,611
Well, I wanted to see how you were doing.

34
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,682
Mom and Dad worry about you.

35
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,019
I'm fine. I'm working very hard.

36
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,757
I hope so.

37
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,758
I'm low on gas. I should fill up.

38
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:19,689
My friend works at a gas station.

39
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:33,679
Welcome!

40
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,050
Hey!

41
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,784
Big brother, that's ltsuki.

42
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,621
Welcome!

43
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,590
Twenty liters of high octane.

44
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,991

00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:51,441
<i>Her brother is really good-looking!</i>

46
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,921
<i>I've seen that Eight-Six Turbo.</i>

47
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,306
I hear you and my sister are friends.

48
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,810
Isn't she too strong-willed'!

49
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,813
No, I don't think so.

50
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,817
Hey, big brother!

51
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,818
Don't ask him stupid things like that!

52
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,221
She's a good girl, so be nice.

53
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:19,684
Yes.

54
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:24,496
This is a complete change of topic,

55
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:27,497
but I hear that Gunma
has a really fast Eight-Six.

56
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,401
What'!

57
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,402
They say he's undefeated.

58
00:04:33,172 --> 00:04:36,172
I know Gunma is pretty big,

59
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,342
but I thought you might
know something about him.

60
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,679
Of course I do! He's my friend.

61
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:45,851
"Seriously?
--Yes.

62
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,020
Itsuki, wasn't it'!

63
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,856
I know we've only just met,

64
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,857
but do you think you could
arrange a meeting with him'!

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,361
I want to talk to him.

66
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,362
I'm curious about his Eight-Six.

67
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,800
Piece of cake!

68
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,801
He's a bit slow, but he's a nice guy.

69
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:07,306
How about tonight?

70
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,307
--You sure'!
--No problem!

71
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,343
I was planning to go see
him after work anyway.

72
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,594
That'd be great.

73
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,986
Thank you very much!

74
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,987
I can't believe he's your friend's friend.

75
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,490
I'm thankful that you guys became friends.

76
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,162
I don't like this.

77
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,163
You seem to only care about ltsuki': friend,

78
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,867
and not about ltsuki.

79
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,837
That's not true. He seems okay.

80
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,506
Why are you meeting his friend?

81
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,342
No reason.

82
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,610
I just want to meet him.

83
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,611
He must be skilled to have won
all his races in competitive Gunma.

84
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,118
I hope that's it.

85
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,620
You tend to lose your cool

86
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,111
when it comes to street racing.

87
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,730
Come on, Takumi!

88
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:07,731
I just want Kazumi': brother to like me.

89
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,068
This is a good opportunity
for me to score some points.

90
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,308
Okay, I'll be there.

91
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:19,309
But I'm not interested in racing him at all.

92
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,415
The new engine isn't that good.

93
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,417
Don't worry about that!

94
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,418
I learned my lesson after the thing
with the Night Kids' Nakazato.

95
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,657
Kazumi': brother seems very nice.

96
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,908
You'll see when you meet him.

97
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,784
<i>It': cool to see three Eight-Sixes!</i>

98
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,541
<i>But mine is an Eight-Five.</i>

99
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,110
<i>He': young.</i>

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,835
You know that Eight-Six Turbo
that came in this afternoon?

101
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,237
I saw it once...

102
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,238
...when I went to see the
Red Suns race the Emperors.

103
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,709
Yeah'!

104
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,379
It had amazing uphill acceleration.

105
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,048
Since her brother drives a car like that,

106
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,049
Kazumi may not be that impressed with ltsuki.

107
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,222
There you go again, lketani.

108
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,533
Your way of thinking
won't help your social life.

109
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:45,395
Itsuki doesn't look like he
worries about things like that.

110
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:50,366
Clumsy but positive guys have an upper hand

111
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,071
over guys who worry too much.

112
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,912
You're still young.

113
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,245
You just got a new engine?

114
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,246
Yeah, but it's a lot slower than the old one.

115
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:06,685
"Right, Takumi'!
--Yeah.

116
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,686
That's why he won't be able to race for a while.

117
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:14,457
"Right?
--Yeah, that's right.

118
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:18,697
Is it a normal 4A6'!

119
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,698
I don't know much about engines.

120
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,202
It has okay power,

121
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,204
but it's hard to control.

122
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,425
It's a weird engine.

123
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,812
Do you mind if I take a look'!

124
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,833
Uh, no, I don't mind.

125
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:44,695
What is this?!

126
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:54,806
It's not a 4AG, even though it is a 4AG.

127
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,841
Is this a joke?

128
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,012
Are you teasing me'!

129
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,613
I don't know where you got this engine...

130
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,784
...but don't insult me by saying that it's slow.

131
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,889
Well, but, um...

132
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,890
--Why is he mad'!
--Who knows'!

133
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,060
I thought we were fellow Eight-Six racers.

134
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,230
Is my cheap turbo not good enough for you'!

135
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,900
You owe me an explanation.

136
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,637
Stop it, big brother!

137
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:34,639
What are you talking about?

138
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Stay out of this, Kazumi.

139
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,710
I've never met anyone who has
an engine like this for street racing.

140
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,382
This engine is for professional racing.

141
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,686
What'!

142
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,487
I could never afford it...

143
00:09:49,488 --> 00:09:52,488
...no matter how much I wanted it.

144
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,825
Picturing this engine in my
Eight-Six makes my mouth water.

145
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,898
So what'!

146
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,567
I don't care what kind of engine you have.

147
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,903
But why lie about it'!

148
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,904
Why can't you say you're fast'!

149
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Both of you disgust me
with your deliberate lies.

150
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,746
We weren't, really...

151
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,448
Don't be ridiculous.

152
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,783
It's not a lie.

153
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,784
Let's go, ltsuki. I'm done talking to him.

154
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,589
--Takumi!
--Running away'!

155
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,730
I'm not done with you.

156
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,797
<i>Oh, no! Takumi is losing it!</i>

157
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,938
<i>This is not good!</i>

158
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,351
Kazumi!

159
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,148
<i>I...</i>

160
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,363
What's the matter with you, big brother?!

161
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,364
Itsuki introduced his friend
to you out of kindness.

162
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,785
Apologize to them!

163
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,439
If you don't want to, then go
and never come back here!

164
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,345
<i>Kazumi...</i>

165
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,847
Don't be rude to my friend!

166
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,848
I'm doing my best to live on my own here.

167
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:31,393
Don't show up randomly and mess up my life!

168
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,126
Okay.

169
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,087
I'll go,then.

170
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,420
--Itsuki'!
--Yeah'!

171
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,755
<i>I'm goingAoo.</i>

172
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,756
Hey, wait! Don't leave me here alone!

173
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,228
--Later.
--Hey!

174
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,229
Hey, wait,Takumi!Takumi!

175
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,712
Hey,Takumi!

176
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,586
<i>I didn't expect her...</i>

177
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,589
<i>...to react like that at all.</i>

178
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,092
<i>I guess coming to Gunma was
a good thing for her after all.</i>

179
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,782
<i>But for me...</i>

180
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,158
I'm sorry.

181
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:16,159
He gets so intense when it comes to cars.

182
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:19,264
There's no need to apologize.

183
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,265
When I saw your confused face,

184
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,268
I got so angry with Wataru.

185
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:28,758
My hand moved before I could stop it.

186
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:36,221
Please don't think that I have a short temper.

187
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,350
Bomtw
any.

188
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:42,351
Actually, I was sort of glad.

189
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:46,558
I know that you got upset because

190
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,899
you wanted to defend us.

191
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,765
Why did you stop?

192
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,766
You know I wouldn't have chased after you.

193
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,437
Now that you're here,

194
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,673
I may want to pick up where we left off.

195
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,674
I don't care what you want,

196
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:08,144
but there is one thing I need to know.

197
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,747
I need to know for sure if this engine...

198
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,419
...is that great.

199
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,420
I can tell it's not a normal engine,

200
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,023
but if you're right and this is a great engine,

201
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,598
I want to know why it lacks power.

202
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,365
I know absolutely nothing about engines.

203
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,905
Are you serious about that'!

204
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,906
How can the owner not know about his car'!

205
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,010
Where did you get this treasure, then'!

206
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
My dad got this engine somewhere.

207
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:49,018
I don't know, because he
didn't tell me anything.

208
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,088
Your dad'! He must work
in the racing industry, then.

209
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,820
No, he runs a tofu shop.

210
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:01,797
<i>How can a tofu guy get this kind of engine?</i>

211
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,468
<i>This isn't something you
can simply buy with money.</i>

212
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,473
Never mind. I, too, am curious
about this engine's full potential.

213
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,047
Can you drive me around?

214
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:19,118
I want to feel the engine for myself.

215
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,055
What's your plan now, Bunta'!

216
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,325
Well, I imagined it would take about a month.

217
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,896
He's had more than enough practice with it.

218
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:37,669
The thing you ordered is here already.

219
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,370
Isn't it about time'!

220
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,406
I don't know.

221
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:45,537
I haven't gotten enough of
a reaction from Takumi yet.

222
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,581
It's good that he's trying to
compensate with his technique,

223
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,173
but he should've noticed by now.

224
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,089
Well, I'll just wait and see.

225
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:15,861
<i>L! feels weird. The shifting
stalls the acceleration.</i>

226
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,710
<i>It hastens of power at the rev limit,</i>

227
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,980
<i>but up-shifting causes a power loss.</i>

228
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,417
<i>This engine is defective.</i>

229
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,418
<i>No need to compare it to a turbo. it': dull.</i>

230
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,389
<i>Why? This can'! be its full potential.</i>

231
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,282
<i>What them'!</i>

232
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,606
<i>Again! Why?</i>

233
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:02,548
<i>Now! get it! I know why.</i>

234
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,896
I can tell you why you don't get much power.

235
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,666
It's very simple and basic.

236
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,538
That thing.

237
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,141
It's your tachometer.

238
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,375
My tachometer?

239
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,878
That tachometer is no good.

240
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,814
It doesn't go high enough.

241
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,815
This is a "high-rev" engine that
generates its power at a very high rpm.

242
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,721
Professional "normally aspirated"
engines are all like this.

243
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,726
The fact that you get a surge of power

244
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,164
right before shifting is proof of that.

245
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,399
You need to rev it higher.

246
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,400
You haven't been able to
use it to its full capacity.

247
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,738
I would say that this engine is capable of...

248
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,334
...at least 10,000 rpm.

249
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,845
A tachometer that only shows
7,000 rpm or so won't cut it.

250
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,863
The treasure is left unused.

251
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,290
This isn't an original Eight-Six engine.

252
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,962
It's called a "4AG,"

253
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,963
but it's a five-valve-head engine

254
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,966
that was adapted from the newer "101."

255
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:26,304
There's supposed to be a "VVT" device

256
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,305
that switches valve timing
at lower and higher rpms.

257
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,409
Its absence means that

258
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:36,349
this is a super high-rev engine.

259
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:41,517
I noticed something while sitting next to you.

260
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,156
The interior panel looks too cheap

261
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,692
for the engine you have.

262
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,693
At least, you need water temperature
and oil pressure gauges.

263
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,032
The person who installed this engine

264
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,902
has terrific knowledge of auto mechanics.

265
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,903
The tires and the brakes are well balanced.

266
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:02,974
So is the body.

267
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,975
So, why aren't the essential gauges there?

268
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,447
There's only one answer to that question.

269
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,616
For whatever reason,

270
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,617
the engine's true power has
been sealed off on purpose.

271
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:16,487
Sealed off'!

272
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,488
It's a simple but reliable way to do it.

273
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,658
A good racer won't over-rev.

274
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:25,296
So, without a new tachometer,

275
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,167
he won't rev beyond the red zone.

276
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:35,871
I've often felt camaraderie
toward fellow Eight-Six racers...

277
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,677
...but never hostility.

278
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,380
This is a first for me.

279
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,381
I have a strong desire to defeat you now.

280
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,319
No matter how well you can race,

281
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:53,422
you're lacking an essential element as a racer.

282
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,260
Huh?

283
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,261
I absolutely can't lose to you.

284
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,954
We'll settle this shortly.

285
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:18,416
I'm lacking...

286
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:20,407
...an essential element'!

287
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,261
<i>Pm in shock.</i>

288
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,162
<i>I got scared.</i>

289
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:38,701
<i>The way he entered comers was beyond belief.</i>

290
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:42,306
<i>He can go way beyond the limit</i>

291
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,307
<i>that my body is used to.</i>

292
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,945
<i>He': ignorant about cars,</i>

293
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:50,615
<i>but his technique is unreal!</i>

294
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,250
<i>It makes no sense!</i>

295
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,986
<i>If! lose to him,</i>

296
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,987
<i>everything that I am will shatter into pieces.</i>

297
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,207
<i>My very existence depends on this!</i>
