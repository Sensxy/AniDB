It's rare for a race to last this long.

20
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,308
It's a battle of endurance.

21
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,044
It's physically and mentally demanding

22
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:55,045
to maintain extreme intensity

23
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,048
while dealing with the
continuous lateral G-force.

Especially when the course is this tricky.

25
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:05,889
Others would've given up already.

26
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,695

<i>So what am I supposed to do?</i>

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,520
<i>I should at least tell her the truth...</i>

33
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,025
<i>Not that WI! change anything.</i>

34
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:43,396
<i>I should tell her that I love her.</i>

Both of them are so intense.

00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,997
They're getting me fired up.

40
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,998
The Levin looks different from the first round.

41
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,739
He's good.

43
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:35,111
<i>His style has changed.</i>

44
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,244
<i>He': so fast that I can't relax at all.</i>

45
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,957
<i>I was being cautious at first.</i>

48

<i>But this round is a different story!</i>

49
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,540
<i>I don'! want to lose now.</i>

50
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,142
<i>H! chase him to the end!</i>

51
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,073
<i>My Eight-Six is finally listening to me.</i>

52
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,883
<i>I've never wanted to win a race this badly.</i>

53
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,588
<i>Is it because he drives an Eight-Six?</i>

54
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,714
<i>I just want to win with my new Eight-Six!</i>

55
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>No;</i>

56
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,255
<i>That was close.</i>

57
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,256
<i>I need to keep my focus,</i>

58
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,859
<i>or H! lose more than just this race.</i>

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
<i>I wonder if Pm getting tired.</i>

60
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:07,347
<i>I've started to wobble a little.</i>

61
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,519
<i>Could it be the tires? Not now!</i>

62
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,722
<i>The rear traction is slipping.</i>

63
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,593
<i>The rear tires are losing their grip.</i>

64
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,896
<i>This isn't good.</i>

65
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,231
<i>I can'! adjust the tires.</i>

66
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,667
<i>I've come this far...</i>

67
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,936
<i>...but maybe this is it.</i>

68
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,777
<i>I may lose!</i>

69
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:53,016
<i>I know Pm losing speed.</i>

70
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:58,004
<i>So why isn't he pulling away from me?</i>

71
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,810
<i>Could it be...? it': the only explanation!</i>

72
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,340
<i>He': having the same problem.</i>

73
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,440
<i>His tires are losing their grip, too!</i>

74
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,648
Takumi!

75
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,402
This is the fourth round.

76
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,443
It's become a crazy endurance race.

77
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,044
<i>Your rear tires must be slipping, too.</i>

78
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,211
<i>The power increase puts
more stress on the tires.</i>

79
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,822
<i>Our powerful cars have been running</i>

80
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,827
<i>at the same pace all this time.</i>

81
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:12,168
<i>It': only logical that we'd
have the same tire problem.</i>

82
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,571
<i>He': good!</i>

83
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,673
<i>It': obvious from behind.</i>

84
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,842
<i>The worse the conditions get,</i>

85
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,843
<i>the better he seems to get.</i>

86
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,481
<i>But he': only human.</i>

87
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,983
<i>He': not invincible!</i>

88
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,064
<i>This is a test of endurance!</i>

89
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,745
<i>Actually, these slippery tires</i>

90
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,325
<i>make it easier for me to see
my car's ultimate capabilities.</i>

91
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,494
<i>It feels natural.</i>

92
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,463
<i>It': running the way I want it to.</i>

93
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,464
<i>I'm all fired up!</i>

94
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,684
<i>This is my new Eight-Six!</i>

95
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,799
<i>Basically, I step on the accelerator to swing.</i>

96
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,068
<i>It': the same as before.</i>

97
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,069
<i>But I can clearly see a major difference</i>

98
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,372
<i>when drifting at full speed.</i>

99
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,039
<i>Dad, I know how to control this cur now!</i>

100
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,829
<i>Uh... what round is this?</i>

101
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,999
<i>I've started to space out a little.</i>

102
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:05,236
<i>Pm getting tired,</i>

103
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,073
<i>but I'm sure he is, too.</i>

104
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,675
<i>At this stage of the race,</i>

105
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,511
<i>it': mentally more exhausting to follow</i>

106
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:15,180
<i>than it is to lead.</i>

107
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:18,181
<i>A little difference in speed won'!
be enough to take the lead.</i>

108
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,518
<i>You can only lose by falling behind.</i>

109
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:26,022
<i>So,you can'! lose when you're leading.</i>

110
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,362
<i>The next comer is that mudslide.</i>

111
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,363
<i>He won'! have enough space to sneak by.</i>

112
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:36,801
<i>I should be safe.</i>

113
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,802
<i>H! keep this up for as long as it takes</i>

114
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,272
<i>until you lose focus and make an error.</i>

115
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,371
What?!

116
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,422
There's less mud on the road!

117
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,019
Don't be reckless!

118
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,270
It's impossible to pass me here!

119
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,582

<i>I won.</i>

121
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:05,021
<i>Dam! I didn't notice that
the mud was pushed aside,</i>

122
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:09,324
<i>which created enough
space for him to get by me.</i>

123
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,198
<i>Regardless...</i>

124
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:16,199
<i>...he was able to gauge
that narrow space accurately.</i>

125
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,269
<i>He': way out of my league.</i>

126
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,545
They've slowed down.

127
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,447
The race is over.

128
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,028
Will it be the Trueno or the Levin'!

129
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,393
The Trueno!

130
00:12:42,394 --> 00:12:44,195
Takumi won!

131

Big brother!

135
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:23,114
Takumi.

136
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,373
Thanks for waiting.

137
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,374
I got back safely, but I'm exhausted.

138
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,402
Get in, Kazumi.We're leaving.

139

144
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,366
How did the race go'!

145
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,567
Well.

146
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,203
I managed to win.

147
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:35,894
I see.You're amazing, really.

148
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,573
It was a complete loss for me.

149
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,788
Even though you brought me there

150
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,791
so that I could be with Kazumi...

151
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:00,455
...I just couldn't tell her how I felt.

152
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,737
I've been thinking about her
constantly since yesterday.

153
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,574
Falling in love with her
made me realize something.

154
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:17,289
Loving someone is really a painful thing.

155
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,329
Loving someone is serious business.

156
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,166
When it doesn't work out,
your chest aches so much.

157
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,572
Laugh at me if you want.

158
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,275
Why would I laugh'!

159
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,077
You know the feeling?

160
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,658

--Yeah.

163
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,250
You only have an hour until your deliveries.

164
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:30,221
I know.

165
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,057
Wake me up when it's time.

166
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,518
Sure.

167
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:41,316
I never knew that our car was that good.

168
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:45,536
Hey, Dad?

169
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,537
Maybe you can teach me
about engines and stuff

170
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,542
when you have time.

171
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:54,543
What happened all of a sudden?

172
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,951
I realized which essential
element I was lacking.

173
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,292
Takumi, ltsuki is acting weird.

174
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:33,041
You'll find out eventually
anyway, so I'll tell you.

175
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,255
I see.That's really unfortunate.

176
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,727
I thought they'd make it.

177
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,038
He's back to being the "Lonely Driver."

178
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,167
ltsuki'!

179
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,740
What?!

180
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,910
Kazumi!

181
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,611
What?!

182
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,612
Didn't you go back to Saitama'!

183
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:05,650
It was all so sudden.

184
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,486
I came back to get my stuff.

185
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,121
Oh, yeah'!

186
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:13,122
But that's not all I left here.

187
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,826
We left in a hurry,

188
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:18,337
so I couldn't say goodbye to you properly.

189
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,532
Kazumi'!

190
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,533
Are you free now'! Just for an hour'!

191
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,360
I have some time.

192
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,078
He had to leave early...

193
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,247
...for personal reasons.

194
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:37,915
Again?

195
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,251
Bittersweet youth...

196
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,252
She's the most important
thing to him right now.

197
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:46,691
That reminds me.

198
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:49,692
Takumi, I heard that your girlfriend

199
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,530
"started a part-time job.
"What?

200
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,191
How are things with you two'!

201
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,177
<i>M091' 90: a job...?</i>

202
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,151
Autumn is almost over.

203
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,985
I'll never forget this autumn in Akina.

204
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,489
I'll think of it every time
the leaves change colors.

205
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:24,894
I'll never forget the people I met in Gunma...

206
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,030
...especially this outspoken
but compassionate boy

207
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,334
who encouraged me to live.

208
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,841
He's a year younger than I am,

209
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,842
and is like the little brother I never had.

210
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,874
I won't forget him.

211
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:08,372
Thank you very much!

212
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,175
Welcome! For here or to go'!

213
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:12,376
<i>Whenever! turned around
Welcome! For here or to go'!</i>

214
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:12,577
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

215
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,578
<i>Whenever I turned around
“Shibusawa Station“</i>

216
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:16,914
<i>There was always that unchanging
smile of yours “Shibusawa Station“</i>

217
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,915
<i>There was always that
unchanging smile of yours</i>

218
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:24,353
<i>It was there on days when
I was too tired to go on</i>

219
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,024
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

220
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,800
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

221
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,108
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

222
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,109
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me
Goodbye, Kazumi.</i>

223
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,099
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

224
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,483
<i>I couldn't tell you this...</i>

225
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,418
<i>The warm wind
Wouldn't tell you this...</i>

226
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,654
<i>The warm wind
"but! loved you.</i>

227
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,655
<i>The warm wind</i>

228
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,725
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

229
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:10,332
<i>it blows through with a radiant light</i>

230
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:23,020
<i>Just like it did that day</i>

231
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,366
Big brother... have you formed
the All Gunma Team yet'!

232
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,534
The grave sin of betrayal Big brother...
have you formed the All Gunma Team yet?

233
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:45,936
<i>The grave sin of betrayal
I've picked the candidates.</i>

234
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,438
<i>The grave sin of betrayal</i>

235
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:48,272
<i>The strength of believing in each other</i>

236
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:51,273
<i>The strength of believing in each other
Now it's up to them to join the team.</i>

237
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:52,576
<i>The strength of believing in each other</i>

238
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,779
<i>The countless days and nights</i>

239
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,415
<i>The countless days and nights
I can't keep losing like this!</i>

240
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:57,783
<i>Let's tuck them away in our hearts
I can't keep losing like this!</i>

241
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,084
<i>Let': tuck them away in our hearts
I'll get my revenge on the Emperors...</i>

242
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:02,420
<i>Let': tuck them away in our hearts
...and Akina': Eight-Six!</i>

243
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,901
<i>Let': tuck them away in our hearts</i>

244
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,431
<i>On the road of meetings and parting:</i>

245
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,340
<i>We keep on walking while our hearts get hurt</i>

246
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,719
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

247
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:51,293
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

248
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:59,282
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>
