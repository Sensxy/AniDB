<i>"Money can'! buy my love"?</i>

00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,555
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,556

"Act 1:The Ultimate Tofu Store Drift"

00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,064
Even the 1991 model costs 1.3 million yen.

31
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,868
The S13 is expensive.

32
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,706
Like I thought, it's gotta be the Eight-Six.

33
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,441
The Eight-Six is a real possibility.

34
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,442
Anyway, the car has to be FR. Right, Takumi'!

35
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,147
Takumi!

36
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,382
Hey! Are you listening?

37
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,284
I'm listening, ltsuki.

38
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,285
So how much is this Eight-Six'!

39
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,723
Well, this one is 300,000 yen...

40
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,392
...but it hasn't passed inspection.

41
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,627
How much have you saved so far'!

42
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,729
About 50,000 yen.

43
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,498
You've got along way to go.

44
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,638
<i>Yeah... Yeah...</i>

45
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,402
Isn't there any way to make
a lot of quick money?!

46
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,507
With our current part-time
jobs at the gas station,

47
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,075
even if we work full-time
during summer break,

48
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,078
we'll only make 120,000 yen at most.

49
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,078
There's gotta be a betterjob out there.

50
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,214
You guys are working part-time'!

51
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,251
<i>M0gi...?</i>

52
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,790
What'! Is it so strange that I'm talking to you'!

53
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,528
Not really...

54
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:26,031
You said you could get 120,000
working full-time this summer.

55
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,467
How many hours are you
supposed to work every day'!

56
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,402
From early in the morning till late at night.

57
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,804
What?!

58
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,804
You can only make 120,000
a month for that much work?!

59
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,210
That's about right...

60
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,210
Wages for high school students are really low!

61
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,315
I didn't know...

62
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,186
I've never had a part-time job...

63
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,057
Good luck with your job!

64
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,826
Let's get together after finals!

65
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,663
Sure!

66
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:00,565
She just said, "Let's get together!" didn't she'!

67
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,566
--Yeah.
--Go out with Mogi?!

68
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,438
Good! Good!

69
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,507
Takumi, why didn't you tell me'!

70
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,508
--You should have told me you're Mogi': friend.
--| haven't talked with her in about a year.

71
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:17,049
We were in the same club.

72
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,018
We talked a lot until last summer.

73
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,019
What are you talking about?
Who cares about that'!

74
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,723
Natsuki Mogi...! What a great turn of events!

75
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,266
I've been checking her out
for a while... She's so <i>cute...</i>

76
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:40,136
Takumi! Hey,Takumi! Quit zoning out!

77
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,040
If we don't hurry, we'll be in big trouble!

78
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,709
We've got a grammar test next class!

79
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,710
Wait up!

80
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,814
Hey, why don't we buy an Eight-Six together?!

81
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,219
If we combine our money,
we can afford the loan.

82
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,387
No way.

83
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:58,223
Why do you want a car that badly'!

84
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,625
Your family already has a car, right?

85
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,027
It's no good.

86
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,028
My old man's car is an automatic
and front-wheel drive.

87
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,732
And it's a diesel. It's crap.

88
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,585
I wouldn't even call it a car...

89
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,373
It has four tires and it runs. It's a car.

90
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,910
You just don't get it.

91
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,911
If it's not fun on the mountain pass,
you can't call it a car.

92
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,950
What do you do on the mountain?

93
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,951
What do you think?! We're going
to challenge the corners!

94
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,522
Challenge the corners...'!

95
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,958
Is that fun'!

96
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,926
Of course it's fun!

97
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,927
You're a guy and you don't
want to tackle the corners?!

98
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,899
I'm already tired of that kind of stuff.

99
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,437
What'! What do you mean'!

100
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:48,188
We just got our licenses last month.

101
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,758
You look cute.

102
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,759
That outfit always looks great on you.

103
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,252
Really? Thank you, Papa.

104
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,201
You know, Papa, one of my
classmates is working part-time.

105
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,940
He says even if he works all summer,

106
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,747
he'll only earn 120,000 yen.

107
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,416
Well, that's about right.

108
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,417
It's hard earning money, isn't it'!

109
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:39,022
You spend more than that on me in a month.

110
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:44,863
Is it really all right to spend so much on me'!

111
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:47,864
Of course. You're worth it.

112
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,303
Really?

113
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,304
I don't understand...

114
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,578
--Thank you very much!
--Thank you very much!

115
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,579
Hey, Takumi! Please think
about the Eight-Six deal.

116
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,552
I don't care about an Eight-Six!

117
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,553
You kids have good taste...

118
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,591
...trying to get an Eight-Six.

119
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,592
See'! See'! lketani thinks so too, right?!

120
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,231
Yeah, the Eight-Six is a good car.

121
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,900
I told you.

122
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,268
<i>But I...</i>

123
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:25,268
To be honest, I don't know
what an Eight-Six is.

124
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,273
Who makes it'!

125
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,175
Are you serious, Takumi?

126
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,010
Want to drink some high octane?

127
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,679
Working at a gas station and
you don't know the Eight-Six?!

128
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,681
What a disgrace!

129
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,518
Oh, well. It's no surprise.

130
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,519
When the Nine-Two model came out,
you guys werejust in 2nd or 3rd grade.

131
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:47,056
We have an old car at my house,
but we just use it for our deliveries.

132
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,362
You can't compare that to an Eight-Six!

133
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,362
Even if it's old, the Eight-Six is special!

134
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,765
When we buy an Eight-Six,
will you let us join your team'!

135
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,035
I've always dreamed of joining
the Akina Speed Stars.

136
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,040
Sure! Oh, by the way...

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,040
It's Saturday, so everyone is
meeting at Mt. Akina tonight.

138
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,079
You guys wanna come along?

139
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,714
What?! Can we'!

140
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,150
But we don't have a car...

141
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,151
I'll give you a ride.

142
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,325
We can ride in your S13?!

143
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,494
I'll go! I'll go! I'm definitely going!

144
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,930
You're going too. Right, Takumi?
This is a rare opportunity!

145
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:28,651
--Um, I never said I wanted to go.
--Cool! I can meet the whole team!

146
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,173
Excuse us.We're going home!

147
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,174
All right! I'll pick you up
at the bus stop at 8 PM.

148
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,210
Okay!

149
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,782
You're really into it.
Which mountain are you going to'!

150
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,783
Boss, Mt. Akina is the only mountain
around here worth racing on.

151
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,387
We're the fastest team on Mt. Akina.

152
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,358
Many claim that they're
the fastest on Mt. Akina.

153
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,863
When I was still racing,

154
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,863
there was a guy that everyone
admitted was the fastest.

155
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,567
And he's still driving on Mt. Akina.

156
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,039
Still?!

157
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,975
I know all the racers at Akina...

158
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,877
...but none of them are that old.

159
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:15,878
It's just because he drives during
a different time. Because...

160
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,784
...he's now the owner of a tofu shop.

161
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,886
What'!

162
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,889
About 4 o'clock in the morning,

163
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,391
he delivers his tofu to the hotels at Lake Akina.

164
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,392
It's amazing to watch his downhill speed.

165
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,463
Because it's his business,

166
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,832
he makes the run every day,
even in the rain and snow.

167
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,833
He knows even the smallest stain
on the asphalt on Mt. Akina.

168
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,940
I'd even bet on it.

169
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,608
The fastest downhill car on Mt. Akina...

170
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:44,343
...is the Eight-Six from the tofu shop.

171
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,344
The Eight-Six from the tofu shop?!

172
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:46,511
"Green Shopping Street"
The Eight-Six from the tofu shop?!

173
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,512
"Green Shopping Street"

174
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,321
Going out, Takumi?

175
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,990
Yeah. I have plans with ltsuki.

176
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,525
I don't care if you're out at night,

177
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,394
but I'll drag you out of bed if you
don't wake up in the morning.

178
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,063
You don't need to remind me.

179
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,064
I'm going.

180
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,384
Shut up,Takumi!

181
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,719
You're ruining lketani': concentration.

182
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,720
Whatever! But this sucks, and I'm scared!

183
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,590
No big deal. Everyone gets scared
when they ride with a street racer.

184
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,061
Next, we'll take the hairpin in second gear!

185
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,291
You're still too noisy, Takumi!

186
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:54,357
All right.Tonight, I'm going all out.

187
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,485
Are you all right, Takumi?

188
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,586
I didn't think you'd get that scared...

189
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,167
I was in the mood and
pushed the car quite a bit.

190
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,027
You're a wimp,Takumi! Shame on you!

191
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,028
You're the type who screams
on roller coasters, aren't you?!

192
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,531
I've never thought that
roller coasters are scary.

193
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,770
It's not like that...

194
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,771
ltsuki, even if I explained it to you,
you'd never understand...

195
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,210
<i>...this fear...</i>

196
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,211
What'!

197
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,560
<i>I've never seen them before...</i>

198
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,900
<i>They're headed for Mt. Akina
at this time of the night?</i>

199
00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,274
<i>Something may happen
on the mountain tonight.</i>

200
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,179
We've got visitors.

201
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,594
<i>The Red Suns?</i>

202
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,554
<i>Are they the Red Suns,
the fastest drivers in Akagi?</i>

203
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:45,054
We're the members of
the Akagi Red Suns Team.

204
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,660
I don't want to be rude, but...

205
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:51,661
Who's the fastest team, or driver,
on this mountain? Please tell us.

206
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:56,167
--What do they want'!
--We're the fastest.

207
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,168
We're the Akina Speed Stars Team.

208
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,959
We consider ourselves the fastest here.

209
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,443
Then we've found what we're looking for!

210
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,412
Would you like to hold a practice session

211
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:10,248
with our team, the Akagi Red Suns,
here at Mt. Akina?

212
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,249
"What?
--Are they serious?

213
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,687
Wow! What a great turn of events!

214
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,292
What do you think'!

215
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,292
Since we usually only run with people
we know, it's becoming routine.

216
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,896
Running against other teams
gives us a new challenge.

217
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,201
We can make new friends
and exchange knowledge.

218
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,570
And it improves our skills, too.

219
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,539
At first, we can run together.

220
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,275
Then each team will be
represented by one driver

221
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,109
to compete in both uphill and downhill.

222
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,044
We aren't concerned about winning or losing.

223
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,914
We only seek to develop
friendship between the teams.

224
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,583
What do you think'!

225
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,583
--If you put it that way, how can we refuse?
--Okay.

226
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,621
How about next Saturday at 10 o'clock'!

227
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,792
Okay, fine.

228
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:56,792
Today, we'll just take it easy.

229
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,290
Awesome! This is awesome, Takumi!

230
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:10,909
We don't need to be intimidated!

231
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,280
--We're going, too!
--Yeah!

232
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,758
lketani!

233
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,560
Let me watch the Takahashi Brothers--

234
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,696
people call them the fastest in Akagi!

235
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,365
You mean the Takahashi Brothers,

236
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,365
the famous street racers who've
been featured in the magazines?

237
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,276
Yes.They're also known
as "The Rotary Brothers."

238
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,043
lketani! What about us?!

239
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:48,044
Sorry.When I make a serious run,
I don't take passengers.

240
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,708
Wait here. I'll pick you up later.

241
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,161
This sucks! Why're we the
only ones without a car'!

242
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,201
Hey, ltsuki...

243
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:13,042
Is it that much fun to be a street racer'!

244
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,341
I don't get it...

245
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,843
Why does everyone get so excited about it'!

246
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:21,079
I'm the one who doesn't get it!

247
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,548
We can hear the sound of cars

248
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,283
running hard one after another, right'!

249
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:27,283
Why can't you get excited about it, Takumi?!

250
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,554
Excited?

251
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,958
Hello, Fujiwara Tofu Shop...

252
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:38,229
Oh, it's just you.

253
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,798
What a surprise...

254
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,866
Just me'!

255
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:44,737
I haven't talked to you in so long,
and this is the greeting I get'!

256
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,540
The other day, you passed me on
your way back from a delivery.

257
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,143
I signaled, but you ignored me.

258
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,879
Nope, it wasn't me.

259
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,880
It had to be you. It was your Eight-Six.

260
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,152
Well, I mean...

261
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,153
...it was my car, but I wasn't driving it.

262
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,157
My son Takumi delivers tofu to the hotels now.

263
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,330
What did you say?!

264
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,166
Since when?!

265
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,901
Five years ago.

266
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,971
Five years ago'! Since he
was in the seventh grade'!

267
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,166
Damn! I can't keep up with them at all!

268
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,066
<i>They're fast! I'm at my limit,</i>

269
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,437
<i>but I can'! keep up with any of the Red Suns.</i>

270
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:00,711
What do you think, brother?

271
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,246
They're all trash.

272
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:05,049
Even our second string can easily beat them.

273
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,418
We don't need to bring
the top drivers next week.

274
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,920
I'll pass.

275
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,722
If you're not gonna come, I guess I'll pass, too.

276
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,524
No, you should run.

277
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:15,693
You should set a record for this course

278
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,029
which the locals can never break.

279
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,064
Otherwise, the name of the Akagi Red Suns

280
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,833
will never become legendary.

281
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,602
<i>Yeah...</i>

282
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,602
First, we'll set new records for
every course in this prefecture.

283
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,840
Then we'll take Saitama,
Kanagawa,Tokyo, and Chiba.

284
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,946
We'll have every record
in the entire Kanto region,

285
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,947
then we'll become legends,
and then we'll retire.

286
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:42,667
That is the Akagi Red Suns'
"Fastest in Kanto Project."

287
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,636
They're incredible.

288
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,472
They are completely different from us.

289
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,473
I'm totally shocked that we got
so beaten on our home ground.

290
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,645
They've put serious money into their
suspensions, and they've got power, too.

291
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,583
There's no way we can
compete with the Red Suns.

292
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,419
But how can we avoid a
challenge on our own turf'!

293
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,189
That's right! We can't back out now!

294
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,190
But guts alone won't beat those guys.

295
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,326
I know that... But...!

296
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,531
It's getting late.

297
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:29,162
Let's get together tomorrow and talk about it.

298
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,905
Street racers don't like losing.

299
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,906
They get too serious about racing.

300
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,776
There's nothing worse than losing to
outsiders on your own home ground.

301
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,752
It's like a law for street racers.

302
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,363
Where's Ryosuke'!

303
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,099
He went home a while ago.

304
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,534
We're the only ones still here.

305
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,770
It's almost dawn.

306
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,231
I guess we should head back, too.

307
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,154
If I get serious, they can't keep up with me.

308
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,175
They're still at that level...

309
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,628
Finally caught up, huh'!

310
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,969
That's not one of ours.

311
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,050
Is that an MR2 or a 180'!

312
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,419
Nice driving. But after two corners,

313
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,500
I won't even see you in my mirror.

314
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,039
An Eight-Six?!

315
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,039
You've gotta be kidding!

316
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:38,761
My FD can't outrun an old Eight-Six?!

317
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:42,731
Is this some sort of nightmare?! Crap!

I knew it! He's going too fast!

323
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,313
There's no more room to slow down!

324
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,844
What the hell?!

325

<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

331

<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

335
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,949
<i>You tried to escape,
but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

336
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,019
<i>Something is within your grasp
and something is forgotten</i>

337
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,023
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

338
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,961
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

339
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,035
