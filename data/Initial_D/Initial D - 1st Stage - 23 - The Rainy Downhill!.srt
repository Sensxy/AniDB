<i>Break into the night, it': the time</i>

<i>With scared eyes, Pm lost in the night</i>

13

<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,943

<i>Then I know! could face the truth</i>

20
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,164
Takumi, you don't look too sharp.

21
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,035
Are you sure you'll be okay in the rain'!

22
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,039
Who knows'!

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,040
I can't go too fast in the rain,
so I'll drive normally.

24
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,878
Who knows if I'll be fast or slow'!

25
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,649
I'll take it easy,

26
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,720
'cause if I crashed, my dad would kill me.

27
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,926
I'll count down!

28
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,928

00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,096

"Act 23:The Rainy Downhill"

32
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,412
The S14 got off to a faster start.

33
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,413
It's not a turbo, but it has a two-liter engine.

34
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,085
It's not just the size of the engine.

35
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:36,086
He used the clutch well on the wet surface.

36
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,089
No wonder he's confident.

37
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,225
That wasn't the Eight-Six': best start.

38
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:47,016
He knows he can catch up once he gets going.

39
00:02:49,402 --> 00:02:51,370
<i>He took the lead!</i>

40
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,371
<i>Oh, no! His powerful $14 will widen the gap,</i>

41
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,494
<i>and we'll be left behind!</i>

42
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:10,656
He's way behind.

43
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,091
This hill is too much for an Eight-Six.

44
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:16,092
But it's downhill from here to the finish line.

45
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:17,397
That Eight-Six is known for
his killer downhill technique,

46
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,397
"Sekimon Entrance" That Eight-Six is
known for his killer downhill technique,

47
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,635
"Sekimon Entrance"
so he'll make a comeback.

48
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,636
So he'll make a comeback.

49
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,256
Hello'!

50
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:46,257
Hey, big brother.

51
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:50,427
The Eight-Six and Kenta in the rain'!

52
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,365
Yeah.

53
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,365
Kenta is very confident
racing against the Eight-Six,

54
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,871
but I know it won't be that easy.

55
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,872
I agree. Drifting through corners at low speed

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,510
is completely different from an actual race.

57
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,381
Yeah. It gets very difficult when
you have to floor the gas pedal.

58
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:16,286
What tire grip can
compensate for on a dry surface

59
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,789
is severely limited in the rain.

60
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,959
You have to shift the weight properly,

61
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,464
or you'll lose control and crash in no time.

62
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,836
I wonder if those two really understand

63
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,837
the difficulty of a rainy race'!

64
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,574
Interesting...

65
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,245
<i>“Those two..."</i>

66
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,013
You liar!

67
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:45,114
You're only interested in the Eight-Six.

68
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:15,066
Help! I'm not ready to die!

69
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:23,286
Darn... it's coming down harder now.

70
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:26,458
The opponent is from Akagi,

71
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,459
so neither one has the advantage here.

72
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,632
The problem is the rain.

73
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:36,202
I wonder if he can perform in the rain'!

74
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,611
I'm sure he can,

75
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,612
because he makes deliveries every day.

76
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,385
I'm sure he's driven on rainy days.

77
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,786
Of course he has!

78
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:57,787
Then his technique

79
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,237
should be effective in the rain, too.

80
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,768
<i>I won'! let you catch up!</i>

81
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,437
<i>I'll widen the gap.</i>

82
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,278
<i>In the rain,I can even
outrace turbo-charged cars.</i>

83
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,682
He swung his tail!

84
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,293
The S14 is running well in the rain.

85
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:38,294
It's hard to control an FR in the rain.

86
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,794
Yeah. It only spins to the side, not forward.

87
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:54,945
It's the Eight-Six!

88
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,555
Unbelievable!

89
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,726
What a drift in the rain!

90
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,502
What was that'!

91
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,671
That drift was scary.

92
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:21,892
I have goose bumps.

93
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:31,213
<i>Is this the same person
who was lost in a daydream?</i>

94
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,586
<i>He said he would take it easy...</i>

95
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:40,223
<i>So is this how he normally drives?!</i>

96
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:44,027
<i>Besides, it's impossible to see in this rain.</i>

97
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,231
<i>How does he do it?</i>

98
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:50,512
<i>It': so dark that I can't even see the road!</i>

99
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,278
<i>Stop that ringing!</i>

100
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,298
<i>This speed is insane!</i>

101
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:20,263
<i>He': not human.</i>

102
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:22,266
<i>He': a monster!</i>

103

106
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,100

107
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,960

108
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,641
<i>What?!</i>

109
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,985
<i>The Eight-Six is on my tail.</i>

110
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,986
<i>How? it can'! be!</i>

111
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,758

112
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,759
<i>We haven'! gone through
that many downhill comers yet.</i>

113
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,866
<i>This isn't happening!</i>

114
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,867
<i>I got caught so easily...</i>

115
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,953
<i>...going downhill in the rain.</i>

116
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,810
<i>But...</i>

117
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,811
...it's not over yet!

118
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,395
They're only inches apart!

119
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,121
Look! The Eight-Six is cutting in!

120
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,391
The Eight-Six is passing him!

121
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,080
He made it look easy.

122
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,915
Are you kidding?

123
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,583
It was worth waiting in the rain.

124
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,584
Yeah.

125
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,223
<i>I can't keep up!</i>

126
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,243
<i>The gap widens with each comer!</i>

127
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,067
<i>I can'! go around the comers as fast.</i>

128
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:45,068
<i>What could be making the difference?</i>

129
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,214
<i>I thought the rain was on my side!</i>

130
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:05,522
Right, I see.

131
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,866
Word from the mid-point.

132
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,867
The Eight-Six passed your guy.

133
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,204
I guess he was way out of Kenta': league.

134
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,374
He did well, though.

135
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:29,405
The Eight-Six is even fast in the rain.

136
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,119
It was obvious even before the race.

137
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,660
The weather plays no part
in defeating the Eight-Six.

138
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,794
It's finally your brother's turn.

139
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,580
--Welcome!
--Welcome!

140
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,498
Welcome.

141
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:21,833
Anyway...

142
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:24,834
...we now know that he can
race just as well in the rain.

143
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:28,738
He's becoming more like
a true racer every day.

144
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,241
He willingly took the 514's
challenge last night.

145
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,045
His daydreaming seems to have passed.

146
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:39,215
I think our operation was a big success.

147
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,852
Yeah.

148
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,555
Anyhow, ltsuki, you were lucky

149
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,926
to be able to experience
that rainy downhill battle.

150
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,564
It was so scary that I
thought I would die for sure!

151
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,049
Besides, he told me to sit in the back instead.

152
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,740
In the back'!

153
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,712
--Why'!
--No idea.

154
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,872
I don't even thinkTakumi
knew the reason for it.

155
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,054
I get it.

156
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:18,054
I think I understand the reason.

157
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,391
Really?

158
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,593
What is it'!

159
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,594
It's because...

160
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,330
--Well...
--Well'!

161
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,733
Itsuki': annoying.

162
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,072
It must be hard to focus when
ltsuki': screaming next to you.

163
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,778
That makes sense.

164
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,968
That's why!

165
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,450
<i>That': not it at all, you boneheads.</i>

166
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,122
<i>He had ltsuki in the back</i>

167
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,122
<i>because he thought he
could get extra tire traction.</i>

168
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:57,827
<i>I bet he knew that intuitively.</i>

169
00:14:59,765 --> 00:15:02,367
Thank you very much.

170
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,368
<i>I have no idea how much better he'll get.</i>

171
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,038
Takumi!

172
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:16,114
Who is she'!

173
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,449
Is <i>that...'!</i>

174
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,519
--His girlfriend.
--What?!

175
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:29,493
"Card Club Pricing"

176
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,229
I don't know why I came,
but I just ended up here.

177
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,734
Yeah'!

178
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:39,285
--Is this a bad time'!
--No.

179
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:49,548
He looks obsessed!

180
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,548
This isn't good.

181
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,126
"Card Club Pricing"

182
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,590
I hate to bother you at work, so I'll go.

183
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,761
Yeah.

184
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,054
Trouble!

185
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:32,054
He may start daydreaming about her again!

186
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,059
Do something, ltsuki.

187
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,059
There aren't any more races for him to see!

188
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:41,197
There's no time for him to daydream

189
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,068
before the big race next week.

190
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,937
I know that!

191
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,873
Hey,Takumi!

192
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,533
Let's go to Akina for a spin tonight!

193
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,258
It looks dirty.

194
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,809
I guess it's because of last night.

195
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:11,389
Hello'!

196
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,558
Who is this'!

197
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,559
It's me. It's been a while, Bunta.

198
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,830
Oh, it's you.

199
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:20,332
What's the occasion?

200
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,500
Did you crash and get hospitalized?

201
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,336
You wish.

202
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,171
By the way...

203
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,171
...I hear people are talking about your son.

204
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,842
I hear he's good.

205
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,514
What'! This Saturday?

206
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,350
Against Ryosuke Takahashi'! Who is that'!

207
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,019
You don't know him'!

208
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:44,019
Even my people know who he is.

209
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,590
I hear he's the best street racer in Gunma.

210
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,093
My son and he are racing, huh'!

211
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:55,064
Who do you think will win?

212
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,047
Who knows'! We'll find out this Saturday.

213
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,541
You haven't changed a bit.

214
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:08,052
I'm curious about the drift
your son learned from you.

215
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
You scarred me for life
with your monstrous drift.

216
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,092
That was years ago.

217
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,061
--Mr. Tsuchiya, we need you.
--Yeah.

218
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,062
Later, Bunta.

219
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,845
I can tell that you've improved a lot, ltsuki.

220
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,749
You really think so'!

221
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,852
That means a lot coming from you,Takumi!

222
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,833
I've been practicing the "grip run," you know'!

223
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,296
Just for you, here's a
brilliant technique of mine

224
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,466
that resulted from hours of practice.

225
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,263
"Illusionary Hell and Tear!"

226
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,778
This is strange!

227
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,548
I had no problem with it yesterday.

228
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,689
The next corner, then!

229
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,889
"Incredible Braking!"

230
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,890
Hold on, ltsuki!

231
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,402
I can relax now.

232
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,403
I was worried you were
daydreaming about girls again.

233
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,342
Girls? What do you mean by that?!

234
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:20,345
I wasn't doing that!

235
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:23,345
But you were acting so weird.

236
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:26,915
I told you that I was thinking...

237
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:31,253
...about what would
happen after this big race,

238
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,090
regardless of the outcome.

239
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,263
Don't you get what I'm saying?

240
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:41,666
No idea.

241
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:43,502
It's all a riddle to me.

242
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,070
Why do you need anything after the race'!

243
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,572
You don't need anything.

244
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,573
You're already fast as it is.

245
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:54,212
I'm not fast.

246
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,714
Yes, you are!

247
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,715
You have an undefeated streak going.

248
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,718
I don't know.

249
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,388
I just don't know where I'm headed.

250
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,093
Can't you just focus on the big race for now'!

251
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,087
You don't have much time left.

252
00:22:16,935 --> 00:22:19,685
Ryosuke Takahashi...

253
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,553
<i>There was a time when I
wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

254
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,392
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

255
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,233
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

256
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:01,349
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

257
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,648
<i>Bloom like a red rose,
I hold you ever so tightly</i>

258
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,188
<i>All I can say is that I believe
my feelings are true</i>

259
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,995
<i>Let': enjoy our happiness...</i>

260
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:28,407
<i>Into our shining future</i>

261
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,219
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

262
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,894
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

263
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,966
<i>Bloom like a red rose,
I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

264
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,
I will never let you go</i>

265
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,480
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

266
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:19,318
<i>wand miraculous flower</i>

267
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,364
<i>It': the moment of truth for your
"fastest racer" theory, Ryosuke.</i>

268
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,569
<i>Pm looking forward to the opportunity.</i>

269
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,373
<i>So, what exactly is your theory?</i>

270
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,374
<i>I'm sure you're familiar with E = mc'.</i>

271
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,512
<i>It': Einstein': Theory of Relativity.</i>

272
00:24:44,015 --> 00:24:47,015
<i>I've added my own sub-theories to it.</i>

273
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,454
<i>"E" symbolizes the opponent':
average speed and...</i>

274
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:53,455
<i>Next on initial D: "Akagi's White Comet!"</i>
