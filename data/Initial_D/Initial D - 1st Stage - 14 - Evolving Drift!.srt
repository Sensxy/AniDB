Don't do it, Takumi!

What'! Takumi is doing
the duct tape death match'!

47
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,543
That's definitely not a good idea.

48
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,679
He snapped because of ltsuki.

49
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,883
I understand his feelings, but it's reckless.

50
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,019
Today is Saturday.Where is Takumi'!

51
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,890
He's off today,

52
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,891
and ltsuki is in the hospital,
so we're short-handed.

53
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,530
I knowTakumi is good,

54
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,365
but I don't know about
a duct tape death match.

55
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:49,366
After work, I'll go convince him not to do it.

56
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,737
We gotta make him stop.

57
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,906
Yeah.

58
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,074
Mind helping me out a little?

00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,377
Welcome!

<i>Without a sense of justice,
the world would be in darkness...</i>

61
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,881
<i>I can'! blame Takumi for his choice.</i>

62
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,084
<i>No one can stop him now.</i>

63
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:10,055
<i>What if we let him?</i>

64
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,566
<i>No. it': too risky against an FF.</i>

65
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,820
I was surprised.This is the
first time you've called me.

66
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,943
I've been upset about something.

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,944
I was thinking, and suddenly thought of you.

68
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,417
Somehow I felt relaxed...

69
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,498
I'm glad you called.

70
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,356
How is ltsuki, by the way'!

71
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,426
He was wearing a seatbelt
and isn't as bad as he looks,

72
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,720
but they still have to do some more tests.

73
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,970
I should go see him.

74
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,431
He would be happy to see you.

75
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,642

76
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,880

You're scaring me a little today, Takumi.

77
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:11,516
"Souvenir"
Oh, sorry!

78
00:04:11,517 --> 00:04:12,384
Oh, sorry!

79
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,385
You seem different.

80
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,420
But I like you like this, too.

81
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,368

82
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,573

--The Eight-Six of Mount Akina

84
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,414
took the duct tape death match challenge

85
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:43,883
from the Night Kids' Number Two.

86
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:46,883
"What?
--His opponent is an EG6.

87
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:49,221
What's he thinking?

88
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:52,222
A duct tape death match is an FR killer.

89
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,558
It's common sense that it heavily favors an FF.

90
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,598
It's common sense...

91
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,000
...but he is racing.

92
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,001
When he races, common sense
goes out the window.

93
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,723
Should we check it out'!

94
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:15,113
<i>Hello...'!</i>

95
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:18,114

00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:22,352
No, we didn't come for... is Takumi home'!

97
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,790
Takumi'!

98
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,791
He took the Eight-Six and left this afternoon.

99
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,628
No idea where he went.

100
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,633
Bunta... have you done a
duct tape death match before?

101
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,540
Yeah, along time ago.

102
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,975
What ifTakumi did it'!

103
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,310
Takumi'!

104
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,311
Well, he's still a beginner,

105
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,117
so he might end up going down the cliff.

106
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,953
Let's look other places, lketani.

107
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,054
Yeah.

108
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,054
Sir, if he comes home,

109
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:01,091
please convince him not to do it.

110
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,552
A duct tape death match...

112
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,592
Let's get going, Shingo.

113
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,592
Yeah.

117
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,655
I'll see you.

118
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,796
Call me, okay'!

119
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:12,797
Sure.

120
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:18,169
<i>Now...</i>

121
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,586
A lot of people are here.

122
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:36,586
I was hoping for a small crowd.

123
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:40,399
After all, we came to talk him out of it.

124
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:45,949
Here come the Night Kids!

125
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,755
I only see you and your slow S13.

126
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,261
Where is the Eight-Six'!

127
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:17,930
Ignore him.

128
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,432
I wonder where Takumi is'!

129
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:24,183
It's almost time. He should
be here any minute.

130
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,099
Here comes the Eight-Six of Mount Akina!

131
00:08:49,395 --> 00:08:51,930
Fujiwara Tofu Shop'!

132
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,931
What is this'!

133
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,272
Takumi, it's not too late.

134
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,774
Don't do this ridiculous race!

135
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,176
<i>Why'!</i>

136
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:07,176
I won't lose to someone like him.

137
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:10,346
He drives an FF! Don't you know that'!

138
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:13,583
Wait... you're the punk from the other night.

139
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,753
You wasted my time.

140
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:19,524
What are you babbling about?

141
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,525
I hope you're not discussing backing down.

142
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,109
Iketani, I'm doing this no matter what.

143
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,205
It's 10:00...

144
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,395
It's almost starting.

145
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,878
I believe in you,Takumi.You can win.

146
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,716
Please win!

147
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,634
Will he be okay'!

148
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,536
Shouldn't we have stopped him by force'!

149
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,537
All we can do now is believe in him.

150
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,242
It's set.

151
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:11,743
They've set up the finish line.

152
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,145
It's time to start.

153
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,145
Okay.

154
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,217
I'll count down! Ten seconds...

155
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:24,654
Eight... Seven... Six...

156
00:10:25,157 --> 00:10:27,159
<i>Five... Four...</i>

157
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:30,159
<i>Three... Two... One...</i>

158
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,196
Gog

159
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,942
It's started...

160
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:46,878
Stay calm, Takumi.

161
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,879
Shingo purposely eased up on
the gas pedal to stay behind.

162
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,883
So that he can watch the
Eight-Six go down the cliff.

163
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,587
No human can drive an FR under
this rule without crashing it.

164
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,417
That Eight-Six won't last three corners.

165
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,305
<i>Don'! be cocky.</i>

166
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,305
<i>The B-16A engine is the best there is.</i>

167
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,644
<i>If I wanted, there': no way</i>

168
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,644
<i>I'd be behind a 4A-G engine at the start.</i>

169
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:26,215
<i>I just wanna see how many
comers you can clear.</i>

170
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:14,715
But I wonder if he can really
make any of those corners'!

171
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,368
Here they come!

172
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,174
Hey, isn't that Eight-Six coming in too fast'!

173
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,346
This could get ugly.

174
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,507
<i>Aren't you going slower than usual?</i>

175
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,367
<i>You're enthusiastic,</i>

176
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,737
<i>but aren't you forgetting something?</i>

177
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,300
<i>Here it goes... it': over.</i>

178
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,077
<i>I pulled it out. Pm lucky.</i>

179
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:38,338
<i>I thought I was gonna sprain my wrist.</i>

180
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,191
He regained control!

181
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,502
Wow! I was sure he'd lost it.

182
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,110
I'm too old for this.

183
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,535
Hey, hey, what happened to your enthusiasm?

184
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,232
I can't just stand here.

185
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,901
Let's follow them!

186
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:31,570
I don't think so, lketani...

187
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,439
With our skills, we won't catch up with them.

188
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,508
I'm not trying to catch up with them.

189
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,508
In case something bad happens to Takumi,

190
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,778
we can reach him quicker.

191
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,182
Hey, wait for me!

192
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,613
I'm getting the hang of this.

193
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:05,064
How is he...?

194
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:08,064
<i>He continues to clear the
comers with little counter.</i>

195
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,868
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

196
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,868
<i>A duct tape death match
can't be mastered instantly.</i>

197
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,374
<i>The safer you try to go,</i>

198
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,375
<i>the deeper you sink" just like an ant-lion trap.</i>

199
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,779
<i>I had to train myself for hours
before I finally mastered</i>

200
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,460
<i>cornering with my right hand
duct-taped to the wheel.</i>

201
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,431
<i>On a straight line, engine power is crucial.</i>

202
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,402
<i>No NA 10-6DOHC engine in the world</i>

203
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,596
<i>can out-perform the B-16A.</i>

204
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:54,744
<i>The sound of revving up to the red zone...</i>

205
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:57,584
<i>it': ecstasy! it': to die for!</i>

206
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:19,468
<i>You see? I can pass you whenever I want.</i>

207
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,907
<i>Maybe you should panic a little.</i>

208
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,908
<i>Let': get going!</i>

209
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:29,832
"Skate Center"

210
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:36,120
My heart speeds up before each corner

211
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,990
with anticipation that the crushed Eight-Six

212
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,492
may suddenly appear.

213
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,094
Hey, don't say that!

214
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,095
I'm sure it'll end without any disaster...

215
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,867
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

216
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,357
...Takumi's abilities surprise me every time.

217
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,625
<i>I can keep the speed up nicely...</i>

218
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,539
<i>It': faster not to steer
too much when cornering...</i>

219
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:26,537
<i>Dam, why;</i>

220
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,673
<i>He': unaffected by my pressure.</i>

221
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,342
<i>He was unstable at the beginning,</i>

222
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:34,123
<i>but he gets sharper as we go.</i>

223
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,688
They'll be here soon.

224
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,689
It sounds like both are still in one piece.

225
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,693
If he couldn't reach this spot,
I'd be wrong about him.

226
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,530
That Eight-Six wouldn't be a worthy target.

227
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
There!

228
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,681
Oh, no! Someone is coming up!

229
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,686
He four-wheel drifted through one lane

230
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,024
without crossing the center line.

231
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,626
What technique!

232
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,395
He did it like it was nothing.

233
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,396
He didn't panic about passing by a car, either.

234
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,569
Is his hand really taped to the wheel'!

235
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,570
Maybe it came off a long time ago.

236
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:37,806
Perhaps he adapted to the situation quickly.

237
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,113
You mean...

238
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:43,915
YOU can attack <i>3</i> corner

239
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,717
by shifting the weight without steering.

240
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,438
He learned that quickly.

241
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:53,258
He's unreal.

242
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,538
Without a doubt, he is evolving.

243
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,399
<i>Dam, what a fake!</i>

244
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:06,571
<i>It'll be hard to label him
as a fake if he keeps that up.</i>

245
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,074
<i>But Pm not like Nakazato.</i>

246
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,444
<i>All I have to do is win, no matter what it takes.</i>

247
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,587
<i>Don'! feel bad.</i>

248
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:26,458
<i>The Eight-Six of Mount Akina
will simply tum into metaljunk.</i>

249
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,972
Wow! After a spin, he turned 360 degrees

250
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,819
and started driving again
as if nothing ever happened.

251
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,847
<i>He got lucky. Pure luck.</i>

252
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,851
<i>Dam, he would've been done
had it been a high-speed comer.</i>

253
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:34,423
<i>That': all right. The victory is mine anyway.</i>

254
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:36,694
<i>I hate that you're still going,</i>

255
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,695
<i>but Pm too familiar with
the rules to lose this race.</i>

256
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,198
<i>H! leave you behind.</i>

257
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,721
<i>Pm pissed off! He did that on purpose.</i>

258
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,884
<i>I refuse to lose to scum like you!</i>

259
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:46,464
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>
