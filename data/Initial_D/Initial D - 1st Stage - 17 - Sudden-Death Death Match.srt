<i>Let': move into the brand new world</i>

15
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,127
<i>Let': dive into the brand new trip</i>

16
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,128
<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

17
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,832
<i>We've just begun, now we go
full speed and funky beat</i>

18
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,136
<i>We will shine around the world</i>

19
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,308
<i>Trip to the world
Yo! Here we go unknown world</i>

00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,344
<i>We newborn travelers</i>

21
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,546
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

22
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,448
<i>The place you want to go is under your feet!</i>

23
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,783
<i>So many people in this world</i>

24
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,185
<i>It's not as if there isn't
backstabbing once in a while</i>

25
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,021
<i>Let': warp past these boring things</i>

26
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,522
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

27
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,522
<i>That': our law!</i>

28
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,131
Please, Takumi!

29
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,131
I couldn't tell this to the others,

30
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,835
but I knew I had to tell you
to make you understand.

31
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:48,872
I don't like this. She makes me mad.

32
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,343
<i>Takumi, don't be angry at Make.</i>

33
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,216
She's a good girl.

34
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,217
I don't know why you have to defend her.

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,220
I don't get it.You don't owe her anything.

36
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,258
I'm begging you, Takumi.

37
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,237
<i>Heyffakumi?</i>

38
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,238
<i>You've never been to other passes, have you?</i>

39
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,576
<i>Could you race here?</i>

40
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,647
<i>I wouldn't know until! tried it.</i>

41
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,525
I'll race her.

42
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,526
Really? I'd be so grateful!

43
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,296
I don't know what you and that
girl expect out of this, but...

44
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,370
Takumi...

45
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,391
I'll go to Usui with my Eight-Six.

46
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:03,095
"Act 17: Sudden-Death Death Match"

47
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,885
Are you serious, Kenji?!

48
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,886
I can't believe Takumi decided to battle it out

49
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,491
with Usui': Sileighty!

50
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,493
Me, neither.

51
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:17,494
It's not like him to go to
another pass and battle it out.

52
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,935
How did lketani talk him into it'!

53
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,737
I'm not really sure.

54
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,738
Iketani doesn't want to talk about it in detail.

55
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,178
We talked about what would happen

56
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,178
ifTakumi raced at another pass, remember?

57
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:37,950
Yeah.

58
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,951
I can kind of understand lketani
wanting to see that happen...

59
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:46,345
But he doesn't have to race
the Sileighty right off the bat.

60
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,029
Is Takumi racing in Usui'!

61
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,830
That's right, boss!

62
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,831
And the Sileighty is that good, huh'!

63
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:57,836
She's better than good!

64
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:03,407
She drifted left and right, and faked
some moves on that narrow road!

65
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,846
Takumi was there, too,

66
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,349
so he knows how good she is.

67
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,352
He'll win, though!

68
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,520
I almost envy your simplicity.

69
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,520
That attendant said that
no local had ever beaten her.

70
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,693
Maybe this time,

71
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:24,203
it's not about winning or losing forTakumi.

72
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,807
I'm out of cigarettes.

73
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,077
I guess I'll go for a little spin.

74
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,522
What them?!

75
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,823
My Eight-Six turned into an Eight-Five.

76
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:52,925
"I borrowed the car. I left you a replacement.
- Takumi" My Eight-Six turned into an Eight-Five.

77
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,385
"I borrowed the car. I left
you a replacement. - Takumi"

78
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,273
Your dad must be freaking right about now!

79
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:12,464
His Eight-Six turned into my Eight-Five.

80
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,380
Iketani, I want to ask you something.

81
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,184
What'!

82
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:22,185
Which side are you on this time'!

83
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,124
Which side'!

84
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:29,125
I just coordinated this race, that's all.

85
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:33,113
Am I supposed to believe that'!

86
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,536
What about Takumi'!

87
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,205
Aren't you sacrificing your friend

88
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,574
to look good in front of Mako'!

89
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,575
"That's not true.
--Oh, yeah'!

90
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:50,725
Then do you really think
Takumi can win this race'!

91
00:05:53,586 --> 00:05:56,806
Do you'! What's your answer?!

92
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,726
<i>I, uh...</i>

93
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,099
He has no chance.

94
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,100
He only knows Akina Pass, and is racing

95
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,336
at difficult Usui Pass for the first time.

96
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,110
I know his technique is incredible,

97
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,111
but that's not the answer to everything, is it'!

98
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:25,448
He's never even driven the pass!

99
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:28,451
Even Takumi can't handle a new
course without any practice.

100
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,157
You must've realized that much.

101
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:37,663
<i>I, uh...</i>

102
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:41,503
Men go crazy for women they like.

103
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,541
To make this summer memorable,

104
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,541
I would like to race
Akina': Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

105
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,212
But don't sell out your friend for a woman!

106
00:06:57,717 --> 00:07:00,717
Have you forgotten that Takumi and
his Eight-Six saved your ass once'!

107
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:05,108
The Eight-Six of Mount Akina is our pride.

108
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,859
Let's stop this nonsense...

109
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:13,397
...or our friendship is over!

110
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:27,960
You're right, Kenji.

111
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,255
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:39,255
I should've come to you
with this along time ago,

113
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,694
but I kept it to myself.

114
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:49,161
I still don't get why you're quitting racing.

115
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,903
It was so much fun when we
started racing two years ago.

116
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:01,037
We've always wanted to
become the fastest here.

117
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,216
It's still fun, though, isn't it'!

118
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:10,088
I can't explain it...

119
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,089
...but I'm just not as intense as before.

120
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,060
I don't know why.

121
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:21,100
I just feel like it's time to move on.

122
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,439
I've done enough...

123
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:32,611
I don't know.

124
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,612
I still don't get it.

125
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,049
I want to have a boyfriend

126
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,050
and a normal relationship, like you do.

127
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,654
You can race and still have a boyfriend.

128
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,592
You can't.

129
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,592
I don't think you can understand how I feel.

130
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:53,299
You have someone you like, don't you'!

131
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:16,085
I must confess that I've
had someone in mind...

132
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:21,424
I was just messing with you. I didn't know.

133
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,628
You couldn't have known.

134
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:28,934
He's not from here,

135
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:31,935
and I was just admiring him from afar.

136
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,340
Oh, my!

137
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,340
You must be the ultimate innocent, shy girl.

138
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,512
And you're 20.

139
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,181
I liked it that way.

140
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,181
I was satisfied with just admiring him.

141
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:48,618
You gotta learn to be more realistic than that.

142
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:51,857
Sorry.

143
00:09:51,857 --> 00:09:54,857
But I do want to test what you and I
have built in the last two years...

144
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:00,863
...in this final race.

145
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,568
You want a final exam.

146
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,537
It sounds good to me.

147
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,406
He's a perfect opponent for you.

148
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,142
Yeah.

149
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:13,142
But I'll tell you this...

150
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,080
As long as we race at Usui Pass,

151
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,081
we have to win, no matter who we race.

152
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,818
I can't accept anything less.

153
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,023
I know.

154
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,024
We have to win, no matter what.

155
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,062
Even if it's against the Eight-Six.

156
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,783
Absolutely.

157
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,771
Well, there's no use racing if you're not into it.

158
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:46,442
Iketani and I will let them know.

159
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,929
You guys turn around here.

160
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,918
Yeah, I'm sorry, Takumi.

161
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:56,919
He means it,Takumi.

162
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,189
Kenji, I'm not going back.

163
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,562
Takumi...

164
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,064
I'm going because...

165
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:08,400
...I do want to race her.

166
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,401
I'm not going back.

167
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,604
Takumi...

168
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,607
But Takumi, you saw what Mako is capable of.

169
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,278
She's too much for you.

170
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:25,415
--Even you can't beat her.
--| know.

171
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,421
This isn't about winning or losing.

172
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,424
Don't say that!

173
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,424
The Eight-Six of Mount Akina is famous now!

174
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,829
Have some pride.

175
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,829
I'm not good at that sort of thing.

176
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,001
I happened to win some local races,

177
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:46,782
and the rumors exaggerated my abilities.

178
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,507
I would feel better if
rumors like that went away.

179
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,646
--Hey...
--Come on!

180
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,849
I'm going.

181
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:01,509
I just want to attack this
new pass as well as I can.

182
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,158
I should apologize for my harsh words earlier.

183
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,262
How could we say anything
to him after that, really?

184
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,201
Yeah.

185
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,202
Well, he's one of a kind for sure.

186
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,439
He's strange.

187
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,676
It's hard to tell if he's special...

188
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,946
<i>...or simply "off."</i>

189
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,830
The tires look good.

190
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,831
The pressure is ideal for this road.

191
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,668
I don't think it's necessary
to make any more adjustments.

192
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,974
If you say so, Sayuki.

193
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,743
I know you know,

194
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,743
but in this kind of race,
avoid wide-angle drifts.

195
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,181
And it's crucial to know when
to drift and when not to drift,

196
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,019
especially with Usui's continuous turns.

197
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,190
I'm with you, so believe in
your technique and go for it.

198
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,551
You won't lose to anyone!

199
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,700
I won't let you down.

200
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:25,203
Together, we're one winning team.

201
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:28,204
--Yeah.
--I'm fired up, Sayuki!

202
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,176
I've never felt this good before.

203
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,177
<i>Pm excited to see how the race will tum out...</i>

204
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,957
<i>wand how good he really is.</i>

205
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,771
So, how are you gonna win this race, Takumi'!

206
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,442
Do you have a plan'! Tell me!

207
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:06,144
Not really.

208
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,713
What?!

209
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:09,548
Can't you think of something?

210
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:12,358
I refuse to see you lose.

211
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,730
How about this'!

212
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,730
Usui Pass is narrow
and has no straight lines...

213
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,400
<i>...so lump the gun and get ahead!</i>

214
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:33,905
<i>What them'!</i>

215
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,906
And you can block her the rest
of the way to the finish line!

216
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:42,078
I can't do that, 'cuz it's unfair.

217
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,082
But if she gets ahead of you, it's over.

218
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:49,253
<i>That's true...</i>

219
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:55,591
Man, we need to come up with a plan!

220
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:59,475
Her car has four wheels just like yours...

221
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:13,143
What?!

222
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,346
Are you really the driver of
the Eight-Six of Mount Akina'!

223
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,186
Unbelievable.

224
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:22,954
How old are you, anyway?

225
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,957
I'm eighteen.

226
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,957
Eighteen? A high school kid'!
You've gotta be kidding me...

227
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,128
Twenty isn't much older than eighteen.

228
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,866
And they're girls.

229
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:38,406
Now we really can't lose to him, right, Mako'!

230
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,149
Let's talk about the race.

231
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:00,756
I don't think it's a good idea
to start side by side here,

232
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,428
because whoever has a better start

233
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:06,429
has a definite advantage.

234
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,266
I'd hate to argue over who
cheated and jumped the gun.

235
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:12,938
There goes my plan!

236
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:15,106
Then how'!

237
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,107
How about a "cat and mouse" race'!

238
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,445
It's a chase race.

239
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,947
If the mouse gets away, it's over.

240
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,948
If not, we keep switching
positions until someone wins.

241
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:29,954
It's a "sudden-death death match."

242
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,955
--Well'!
"That's fine.

243
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,793
Since we're the locals here,

244
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:39,573
you get to choose whether you
want to be the cat or the mouse.

245
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,468
--Well...
--Hold on a sec!

246
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,469
Come here, Takumi.

247
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,606
With this rule, you should go in front first.

248
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,112
It won't end with one race,

249
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,280
but at least you get one practice.

250
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,217
It's better to lose in the second race.

251
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:02,218
He'll go in front first.

252
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:05,323
I'll win in the second race, then.

253
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:08,324
I don't mean to ignore your good advice,

254
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,496
but I don't thinkl like that.

255
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:16,968
What are you saying, Takumi?!

256
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,904
--I'll chase her first.
--What?!

257
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,905
--Wha...7!
--Think it over, Takumi!

258
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,475
This is my race, so let me decide.

259
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,478
<i>But...!</i>

260
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,584
--I'll chase.
"What?

261
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:36,187
You'll chase'!

262
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:38,938
Is he trying to insult us, or is he an idiot?

263
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,592
It's okay. I'll smoke him!

264
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,146
Who is it'! I'm busy.

265
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,615
Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

266
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,117
Hey, Bunta'!

267
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,953
It's only you.

268
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,221
I'm busy right now.

269
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:14,292
I thought I should tell you
something about Takumi...

270
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,896
Should we start the race'!

271
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:21,897
He went to Usui for a race'! So'!

272
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:25,301
"So?" Is that all you can say'!

273
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,906
Aren't you worried'!

274
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,906
Not really. He's my son, you know'!

275
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,143
We'll go slowly, so just follow us.

276
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,880
After the first turn, we'll go full speed.

277
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,354
That's the beginning of the race.

278
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,041
Is that all you have to say'!

279
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,576
That's all.

280
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,647
I'm busy, so don't call me about nonsense.

281
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,082
Hey, Bunta?!

282
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,954
I was an idiot,Takumi.

283
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,259
I realize that now.

284
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,427
<i>I know...</i>

285
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,428
...that the only reason you
agreed to try this losing race

286
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,968
was to save my ego.

287
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,969
I'm regretting it now.

288
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
You're Akina': racer.

289
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,949
You're our pride.

290
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:45,815
This is a huge mistake.

291
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,619
I don't wanna see you lose
because of my stupidity.

292
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,293
He won't lose, lketani!

293
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,104
Reality isn't that simple, you know.

294
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,165
It's my fault.

295
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,166
Iketani...

296
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,104
lketani...

297
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,104
I chose to be the cat for a reason.

298
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,841
What'!

299
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,980
I'm not sure if I'll win,

300
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:18,981
but I'm not here to lose.

301
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,851
So, you do have a plan'!

302
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:26,457
It's not really a plan...

303
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,859
More like an inspiration.

304
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,860
--What is it, Takumi'!
--Tell us!

305
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:36,200
No matter how fast she is,

306
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:38,036
she can't fly.

307
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,704
Yeah'!

308
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,705
She's driving on four wheels, too.

309
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,709
<i>Four wheels...'!</i>

310
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,710
Then I should be able to turn these corners

311
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,713
as fast and as well as she can,

312
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,352
don't you think'!

313
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,887
You're right!

314
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,557
Theoretically, it's true.

315
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,892
That's crazy talk!

316
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,893
We're going!

317
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,702
Let's go, Mako!

318
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:12,804
Let's finish him quickly!

319
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,614
Okay, Sayuki. I'll show you the best race ever!

320
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,383
Wow,

321
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,018
They're going full throttle already!

322
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,019
Takumi': first "away" race has finally started.

323
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:08,624
Takumi is at a serious
