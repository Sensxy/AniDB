<i>Bu! you don'! know what
choice you should take</i>

4
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,163
<i>"Money can'! buy my love"?</i>

<i>You can'! even take a breath
in the sleepless city</i>

10
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,110
<i>Never showing weakness but laughing</i>

11
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:51,114
<i>Safety is in lies, truth is empty</i>

12
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,185
<i>On the edge of danger,
I wanna shout and break out!</i>

13
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,956
<i>Now we gotta start let's get moved!</i>

14
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,858
<i>Let': move into the brand new world</i>

15
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,094
<i>Let': dive into the brand new trip</i>

16
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,095
<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

17
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,865
<i>We've just begun, now we go
full speed and funky beat</i>

18
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,136
<i>We will shine around the world</i>

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,308
<i>Trip to the world
Yo! Here we go unknown world</i>

20
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,377
<i>We newborn travelers</i>

21
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,580
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,448
<i>The place you want to go is under your feet!</i>

23
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,783
<i>So many people in this world</i>

24
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,218
<i>It's not as if there isn't
backstabbing once in a while</i>

25
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,054
<i>Let': warp past these boring things</i>

26
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,555
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

27
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,556
<i>That': our law!</i>

28
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,077
<i>He': caught up with me?!</i>

29
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,857
<i>What': happening? I must be going crazy!</i>

30
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:00,586
This is the straightaway
in front of the skating rink.

31
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,721
The two of them just passed!

32
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,690
He's on Keisuke': bumper!

33
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:06,959
Akina': Eight-Six is unbelievably fast!

34
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,710
Keisuke': FD has never had
anyone keep up with it this far!

35
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:17,033
Man, I've got goosebumps...

36
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,705
Great attack!

37
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,706
That Eight-Six': attack was aggressive.
It was an incredible kamikaze technique!

38
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,978
<i>My old man...</i>

39
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,789
<i>Unless I pass that car,
he won't admit that I won...</i>

40
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:34,486
<i>There': no other way...
I guess! have to do that...</i>

41
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,422
<i>A full tank of gas is riding on this...</i>

42
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:41,263
<i>The setup point is in the next
five consecutive hairpin curves!</i>

43
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:47,878
"Act 5: Dogfight!"

44
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,419
<i>Damn!</i>

45
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:18,562
<i>What': going on? Of all days,
today the FD feels extremely slow!</i>

46
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,419
<i>ls the secondary turbine still working?</i>

47
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,738
This is the top of the mountain.
Can you hear me'!

48
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,373
Ry0sukez

49
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,675
Pretty soon,

50
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,177
the two will reach the five
consecutive hairpins up there.

51
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,512
Give me the play-by-play-

52
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:09,348
Tell me what's happening in
as much detail as possible.

53
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,717
Okay. They're very close to us now.

54
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,718
I can hear the sound of tires
squealing.They'll be here soon!

55
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,022
Here they come!
Keisuke': FD! And the Eight-Six!

56
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,359
They're neck and neck!

57
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,434
Wow! Great! That Eight-Six is amazing!

58
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,436
It did a perfect braking-drift!

59
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,437
Keisuke is losing ground.

60
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,208
His recovery is great, too!
It's so close to the guardrail!

61
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,238
They're going into the second
hairpin!There's no gap now!

62
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,034
Recovery is the same for both of them!

63
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,726
The FD got close to the outside!
The Eight-Six is...!

64
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,664
<i>The hairpin is coming!
But he's not slowing down!</i>

65
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,665
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

66
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,440
The Eight-Six is going into the
hairpin at an incredible speed!

67
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,244
Are his brakes out?!

68
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,516
What's that?!

69
00:05:24,123 --> 00:05:27,903
Keisuke was passed! Easily on the inside!

70
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:34,366
That can't be true...

71
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,367
We don't understand
what's happening! Be exact!

72
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,437
But...we were watching it...

73
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,875
...and a car shouldn't be able to turn

74
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,875
at a speed exceeding the tire': grip, right'!

75
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,880
But that Eight-Six turned in a weird way.

76
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,615
It was kind of like a roller coaster,
even though that line was

77
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,884
supposed to be bad on the inside turn.

78
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,665
I have no idea what happened!

79
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,158
I know what the Eight-Six did.

80
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,163
What'!

81
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,163
It's a stupid thing, but no one can imitate it.

82
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,668
And it can happen only here on Akina.

83
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,685
I can't believe anyone would
try something so stupid.

84
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,045
<i>I've got something to look forward to...</i>

85
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:23,046
<i>Akina': downhill specialist...
You will be beaten by...</i>

86
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:28,083
<i>mmeffakeshi Nakazato of the Myogi Night Kids!</i>

87
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,793
This is the finish line! I can
hear the sound of their engines!

88
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,794
They're almost here!

89
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,564
Here they come! Which one': in the lead?!

90
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,799
It's the Eight-Six!

91
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,802
Wow! What's going on?!

92
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,270
Keisuke': FD is coming, too!

93
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,105
But there is too much of
a gap for him to cover!

94
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,106
The Eight-Six easily wins!

95
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,879
<i>Crap!</i>

96
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,581
<i>My FD beaten by an Eight-Six?!</i>

97
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,717
<i>That': impossible!</i>

98
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,438
<i>350 horses defeated by a shabby Eight-Six?!</i>

99
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,492
The Eight-Sixjust crossed the finish line!

100
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,160
Keisuke has lost!

101
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,651
We did it!

102
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,216
<i>Am I having a nightmare?</i>

103
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,117
<i>I lost to an Eight-Six?! Twice?!</i>

104
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:40,757
Wow! He won! That spacey Takumi!

105
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,028
Great! It's too cool! I'm totally numb.

106
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,232
I feel like I'm going crazy.

107
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,303
--He did it!
--Yeah!

108
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,405
Iketani! Don't cry! You idiot!

109
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,374
<i>I don't know why... But I'm happy...</i>

110
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,910
Let's take lessons from him...

111
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,911
Like drift control, and picking a line...

112
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,014
Let's put the Speed Stars' sticker
on it without him knowing!

113
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,319
Oh! I volunteer to do that! lketani!

114
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,489
All right. I'll count on you...!

115
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,825
It was a clear loss.
Let's admit it with some grace.

116
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,665
How about the timed run
for the uphill, Ryosuke?!

117
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,568
The uphill doesn't mean anything.

118
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,569
By tomorrow, rumors will
spread among the street racers

119
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,340
that the undefeated Red Suns
lost to an Eight-Six from Akina...

120
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,014
We will have to get even soon...

121
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,015
<i>...with my FC.</i>

122
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,292
A full tank of gas...

123
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,292
That's what you promised.

124
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,529
You promised!

125
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,037
I see... He won...

126
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,878
I knew he would win even
before the race began...

127
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,231
This right is where I was
passed by the Eight-Six.

128
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,404
I just don't get it.

129
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:40,739
How could the Eight-Six,

130
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,740
which isn't good on inside corners,
go through it faster than my FD'!

131
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,778
Just remembering it gives me the creeps.

132
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,709
He may be a real ghost...

133
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,523
Keisuke...

134
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,991
Tell me exactly what happened at that time.

135
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,992
Was there anything strange?

136
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,763
Come to think of it, I heard a
strange sound. Like scraping!

137
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
A strange sound'!

138
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:14,572
I see... Now I understand.

139
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,074
What'!

140
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,945
Should I tell you why you lost'!

141
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:38,594
He used this.

142
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,765
--A drainage ditch'!
--Yes.

143
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,637
He dropped his inside tires
into the ditch on purpose

144
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,638
and resisted the centrifugal
force by hooking it.

145
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,609
In that way, it is theoretically possible to gain

146
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,010
more cornering force than the tires can grip.

147
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,316
It is too obvious and simple,
and it's a ridiculous idea.

148
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:04,754
It wouldn't be successful
if he'd never done it before.

149
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,891
I assume that he probably
practices like this regularly.

150
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:13,213
He must have run Akina for many years.

151
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,701
Damn!

152
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,903
The mountain downhill is fun

153
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,872
because this kind of thing happens.

154
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:21,907
It's been a while

155
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,717
since I've met a target that
I can get excited about.

156
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,747
Let's cancel the expedition
we were planning for next week.

157
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,550
Until we have a complete victory
at Akina, we can't move on.

158
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,771
I'll beat the Eight-Six!

159
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,517
"Green Shopping Street"

160
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,940
Bunta! Are you in?!

161
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,274
"Closed Today"
Bunta! Are you in?!

162
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,276
"Closed Today"
It's me!

163
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:57,976
<i>W'
m“!</i>

164
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,445
Oh, it's hot.

165
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,613
Oh, it's Yuichi...

166
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,381
Good timing!

167
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,217
I have a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce.

168
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,553
Sorry to bother you,
but can you give me a ride'!

169
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:12,364
What'! Are you using me as a taxi'!

170
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:20,062
I heard Takumi was great...

171
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,466
lketani and the others have been
excited about it all morning.

172
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,070
It's not particularly great.

173
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:29,071
I've heard that the expectations
of kids these days are pretty low.

174
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:33,376
He doesn't like driving cars.

175
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:36,579
Is that right'! I can't believe it.

176
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:39,250
He has such a great technique.

177
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,251
To him, driving a car equals
helping with my business.

178
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,390
I've forced him to do it
since he was in junior high,

179
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,393
so he can't imagine that driving is fun.

180
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,431
<i>I see...</i>

181
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,431
He's somewhat cynical about it.

182
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,769
But the chase on the
downhill ofAkina last night

183
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,782
might have given him
something to feel passionate about.

184
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,513
Speaking of which, I didn't see the Eight-Six...

185
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:10,282
Where is Takumi'!

186
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,950
I don't know what's going on,

187
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:15,021
but he went somewhere
this morning in a good mood.

188
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,001
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

189
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,218
Wow! It's cold!

190
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,184
Takumi, you're...

191
00:15:20,185 --> 00:15:23,185
...a very good driver.

192
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,623
Really?

193
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,624
To tell you the truth, I usually get carsick.

194
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,862
Sol brought medicine for it.

195
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,132
But I didn't feel sick at all
when you were driving.

196
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,971
This is the first time I didn't get sick

197
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,282
after being in the car for so long.

198
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,410
Do you ride in cars that often'!

199
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,746
<i>Oh... not that often...</i>

200
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:56,293
Just when my family goes
out and my father drives...

201
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:01,025
<i>She is strange...</i>

202
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:04,026
<i>I was just driving like I usually do</i>

203
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,086
<i>so I don'! spill the water in the paper cup.</i>

204
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:16,040
<i>It was strange yesterday...</i>

205
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:19,041
<i>The car running in from of me
was getting closer and closer,</i>

206
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,679
<i>and the next thing I knew...</i>

207
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,820
<i>...I found myself getting a
charge out of chasing it.</i>

208
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:48,237
<i>I've never thought driving was fun before...</i>

209
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,110
<i>Even today, when I was
driving with Magi next to me,</i>

210
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,713
<i>it was a lot of fun.</i>

211
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,443
<i>Driving isn't that bad...</i>

212
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:04,489
Hey,Takumi.

213
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,490
Hey! Hello!

214
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,495
You were daydreaming just now.

215
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,930
Were you spacing out'!

216
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,931
You're rude, Takumi.

217
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,369
When a person has a cute girl with him,

218
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,370
do you think he should be off
in his own little world'! Really!

219
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:24,909
Sorry! What did you say'!

220
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,450
I just asked if you have a girl you like.

221
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,743
I don't have anyone in particular...

222
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,832
Although I do have someone I
can't help thinking of a little...

223
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,529
How about you'!

224
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,231
I also have...

225
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,272
...someone I can't help thinking of a little.

226
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,372
What are you saying? Don't be a copycat.

227
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,348
Boy!

228
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:05,583
I don't know how many times

229
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,584
I was asked the same thing this morning.

230
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,522
"Who was in that Eight-Six yesterday?"

231
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,825
I was asked many times, too.

232
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,826
Anyway, he beat Keisuke Takahashi.

233
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,929
It's no surprise that people are talking.

234
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,200
I got a little carried away...

235
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:25,201
I told everyone that the Eight-Six was

236
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,371
the secret weapon of the Speed Stars.

237
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,208
We have to find a way to get
Takumi to join the Speed Stars.

238
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,076
Otherwise, we'll be embarrassed later.

239
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,077
Iketani! Leave it to me!

240
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,380
Because I'm his best friend,

241
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,852
I'll make him do it.

242
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:42,588
Are you sure, ltsuki'!

243
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,389
Of course!

244
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:47,379
I know his weak points, too...

245
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:52,361
But in return, please let
me join the Speed Stars!

246
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,265
IfTakumi will join us, you're in. Right'!

247
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:59,402
<i>Yeah...</i>

248
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,840
Lucky! The negotiation was successful!

249
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,676
But how are you going to get a car'!

250
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:07,678
I'm glad you asked!

251
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,680
I've already made up my mind!

252
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,816
Oh! You've finally saved up the money!

253
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,817
I'll ask my dad to sign for me
and get a loan for an Eight-Six!

254
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,324
Takumi has a Panda Trueno,

255
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,026
so I'll look for a red or black Levin...

256
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:25,027
...and someday we'll be
called the Eight-Six Pair,

257
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,113
the fastest in Akina.

258
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:33,705
<i>But, ltsuki...</i>

259
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,705
...Takumi's Eight-Six is not a normal Eight-Six.

260
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:38,743
That's right.

261
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,744
It was faster than the FD
with 350 horsepower...

262
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:46,615
It must have incredible tuning.

263
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,852
I'd like to take a peek under the hood.

264
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,856
Instead of that, why don't you go along

265
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:58,294
when he goes for Akina': downhill record?

266
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,232
Wow! That's a good idea!

267
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,234
I want to ride, too!

268
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,235
We can go where no one has gone before!

269
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:09,972
--| can't even imagine it...
--Yeah...

270
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,042
I bet it's greater than any
extreme roller coaster.

271
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,415
<i>Yeah...</i>

272
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:21,196
Crap! Right now, Takumi is...!

273
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,118
"Beach House"

274
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:40,283
Wait a minute!Takumi!

275
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:48,312
Excuse me! Could you take our picture?

276
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,313
All right.

277
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,085
What's this'! We're going to take a photo?

278
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,988
We came all this way. It's for our memories.

279
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,023
Smile! Smile!

280
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,024
Here we go.

281
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,728
Excuse me! One more!
Please take one more picture!

282
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,232
That's enough...

283
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,232
Never mind, never mind!

284
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,493
Oh!That white FC!

285
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,561
That's Ryosuke Takahashi.

286
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,562
Finally, Red Suns' No. 1 showed up!

287
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,767
What for'!

288
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,169
Must be revenge for his brother.

289
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,138
Can you think of anything else'!

290
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,740
That was just yesterday!
He came here already?!

291
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:52,841
He must be really mad about being
beaten by the Eight-Six. I wonder...

292
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,791
That's an R32 I've never seen here.

293
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,253
A black R32...

294
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,253
Something about it makes me shiver...

295
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:06,356
Who is that'!

296
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,497
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

302
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,642
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

303

<i>'Cuz Pm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

304

<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

<i>You tried to escape,

00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,102
<i>Let': ignore the constraints of logic</i>

319
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,070
<i>'Cause theyWe a pain</i>

320
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,206
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

321
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,408
<i>Something they would know</i>

322
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,408
<i>Rage your dream,
continue on the unending road</i>

323
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,446
<i>Don'! look back on your love or your past</i>

324
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,450
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

325
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,970
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

326
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,132
<i>Damn! You traitor, Takumi!</i>

327

<i>All of a sudden you're strolling in!</i>

328
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,871
<i>He went to the ocean with Magi
and without me, his best friend!</i>

329
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,443
<i>You wanted to see Natsuki
in her swimsuit, didn't you?</i>

330
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:41,145
<i>Of course!</i>

331
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,247
<i>Takumi was alone with her.</i>

332
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,248
<i>He must have done something
with her! I'm sure of it!</i>

333
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,720
<i>Next time on Initial D!
A new battle is in the air...</i>

334
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:55,925
<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
