38
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,120
What are they doing'!

39
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,556
They're changing the FD': tires.

40
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,557
They seem to have several spares in that van.

41
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,161
They're changing the tires
to suit the conditions...

crap..-

44
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:53,138

00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,641
What'! Ah...thanks.

46
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,010
Isn't it past 10 yet'!

47
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,641
Well... It's about 9:40...

48
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:10,422
Dammit...!

49
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,224
It hasn't come yet...

50
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,726
Brother, that Eight-Six...

51
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:16,395
...irritates me!

52
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,396
I was convinced that it could represent Akina...

53
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,634
Was I ever wrong! I've lost all my enthusiasm!

54
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,404
Now I'm going for the best time,
and I'll run away from them.

55
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,773
And I'm going to humiliate them.

56
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:29,774
If I don't, I won't be able to stand it!

57
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,151
Iketani, it's almost time.

What...What about the timed run?

64
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,509
We're going to start in a bit.

65
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,877
Good! I'm in time!

66
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,878
And who's representing the Speed Stars'!

67
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,516
<i>Well...</i>

68
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:13,516
Kenji, get ready... at least mentally...

69
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,521
<i>Yeah...</i>

70
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,223
You're representing the team?!

71
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,594
Good luck! I'll be cheering you on!

72
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,200
This is the starting line.

73
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,201
Are you ready'!

74
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,405
This is the finish line.

75
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:35,540
Everyone is in their designated positions.

76
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,576
You can start any time.

77
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,478
Roger!

78
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,479
So...should we start now'!

79
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:45,749
He didn't come after all...

80
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,153
I'm counting on you, Kenji.

81
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,154
<i>Yeah...</i>

82
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:02,151
Are you kidding? This is my opponent?

83
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,706
Kenji.

84
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,708
You look pale.

85
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,009
You're sweating...

86
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,077
We're even feeling kinda
sickjust watching you.

87
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:13,946
That's easy for you to say... But...

88
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:16,014
Toughen up! Get mean!

89
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:18,750
All right.We'll start the countdown.

90
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:20,751
<i>Damn“)!</i>

91
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,390
10 seconds!

92
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,792
Wait a minute!

93
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:31,043
This is the finish line. A regular car
just passed us and went up there.

94
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,934
You don't want to pass it during the race...

95
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,770
Should we wait until it reaches the top'!

96
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,638
This is a public road.

97
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,607
There's always going to be regular cars!

98
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,409
Forget about it! Start us!

99
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,545
All right.

100
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,647
Wait a minute!

101
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,927
Can you ask him what make that car was'!

102
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,286
Could you tell what kind of car it was'!

103
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,287
Well... I think it was a car
with flip-up headlights...

104
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,427
I think it was probably a Trueno, an Eight-Six...

105
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,731
Give that to me!

106
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,200
What color was the Eight-Six?!

107
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,902
Why are you guys so curious about that thing?

108
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,704
It was black and white.

109
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,674
It's a Panda Trueno.

110
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,675
He's here!

111
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:22,912
He showed up! My prey.

112
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,517
What are you going to do'!
Is it okay to begin the countdown?

113
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:27,019
No! yet!

114
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,588
Wait until the Eight-Six arrives.

115
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,589
My real opponent shouldn't be
the 180 next to me. Right'!

116
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,363
Yeah, that's right.

117
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,365
Kenji, you can go back now.

118
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,768
<i>Yeah... That's quite</i> a <i>relief...</i>

119
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,370
Your eyes are watering.

120
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,539
Yours, too!

121
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,540
He came through for us...

122
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,144
...so that he could protect the
Akina street racers' pride...

123
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,815
That's enough for me...!

124
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:59,886
Now I can start feeling like I don't
care about who wins or loses.

125
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,539
<i>What is this...?</i>

126
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,575
<i>H: seems strange...</i>

127
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:25,575
<i>There are people at each tum...</i>

128
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,578
<i>What are they doing harem?</i>

129
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,849
<i>I think! came to a weird place...</i>

130
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,886
<i>Oh, well, I guess it's all right...
If! win, I get a full tank of gas.</i>

131
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,636
<i>And I can go to the ocean without any pressure.</i>

132
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,477
What's up, Takeshi'!

133
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,912
Nice technique!

134
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:02,581
The way the back end moved
when it pulled out of the corner...

135
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,549
...was a nice touch.

136
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,385
What?!

137
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,520
Didn't you see it'!

138
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:09,922
<i>If</i> you <i>say so... But...</i>

139
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,922
To us it just looked like a regular
Eight-Six with a brat driving it.

140
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,097
A car driven by a street racer
who is at a level where

141
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,097
he can maneuver it as easily
as his own hands and feet...

142
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,502
...has an aura about it.

143
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,503
Ryosuke Takahashi': driving has a strong aura.

144
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,775
His younger brother
Keisuke': aura is still weak.

145
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,776
But that Eight-Six was emitting a strong aura.

146
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:38,081
If he represents Akina...

147
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,124
...the winner is up in the air.

148
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,525
<i>He': almost here.</i>

149
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,293
<i>He really came.</i>

150
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:50,695
<i>The fastest man on Akina': downhill!</i>

151
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,565
<i>The legendary super technician!</i>

152
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:56,566
<i>We'll show the Takahashi Brothers
Akina': real strength!</i>

153
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,739
<i>Come on, Eight-Six!</i>

154
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,740
<i>Pm looking forward to seeing
who gets out of the car.</i>

155
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:07,043
<i>It': been a while since I've been so excited.</i>

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,681
<i>He': kept us waiting for so long...</i>

157
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,816
<i>Bu! such an obvious
strategy won't work on me.</i>

158
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,187
<i>H! be watching you very closely.</i>

159
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,491
Here it comes!

160
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,862
Give him a path! Show him to the starting line!

161
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:34,172
What's that car'!

162
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:36,508
Everyone was waiting for that car.

163
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,377
But it's an Eight-Six.

164
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:42,977
Crap! Where did all these people come from?!

165
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:00,199
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

166
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,200
<i>Excuse me...!</i>

167
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,751
Oh, the Eight-Six! Is it...'!!

168
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,245
Takumi!

169
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,245
Wow! It's him!

170
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,727
So this is the guy...

171
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,943
Takumi!

172
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,145
What's going on?!

173
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,412
What happened to your father?!

174
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:50,348
My father told me to show up.

175
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:53,349
Even if the car is here, without
your father, what good is it'!

176
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,687
What?!

177
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:57,423
What are you going to do, lketani'!

178
00:10:57,423 --> 00:11:00,025
--This isn't... what you said...
--Because you said... we're all right...

179
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,727
<i>--I knew! shouldn't have come.
--Kenji has to race after all...!</i>

180
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,728
<i>Damn my old man! He really irritates me!</i>

181
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:09,098
Takumi! Didn't your father say anything else?!

182
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,970
He just told me...

183
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,971
...to beat the FD on Akina': downhill.

184
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,376
What?!

185
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:20,376
Did he tell you to drive?

186
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,581
<i>Yes...</i>

187
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,250
Can you beat...

188
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,053
...Keisuke Takahashi'!

189
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,054
Well... I can't be sure until we really <i>race...</i>

190
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,393
I've beaten him before...

191
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,595
You won once before...'!!

192
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,596
A full tank of gas is riding on this race...

193
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,543
...so if you let me, I'll win no matter what.

194
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,640
<i>Excuse me... Excuse me...</i>

195
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,976
Takumi! You idiot!

196
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,315
Ouch! What are you doing?!

197
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,316
Takumi! Just how stupid are you?!

198
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,519
I'm so embarrassed watching
you that I'm blushing!

199
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:05,924
Move your car right now!

200
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,126
Don't interfere with the race!

201
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:09,962
Get in that Eight-Six now!

202
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,530
Wait a minute, ltsuki.

203
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,432
Iketani! I'm so sorry!

204
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,433
He is so stupid that he
doesn't understand anything.

205
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,406
Please forgive him!

206
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,407
Takumi... Do you, by any chance,

207
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,810
also deliver tofu, along with your father?

208
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:31,114
Now I do all of the deliveries.
For the past five years.

209
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,617
For the past five years'!

210
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,123
Now I understand. Takumi!

211
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,726
All right. I'll put you in
charge of the downhill race.

212
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,297
What are you talking about, lketani?!

213
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:49,298
If a novice like Takumi
tries the Akina downhill,

214
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:52,070
within minutes he'll cause
an accident and he'll die!

215
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:55,471
Don't worry about it.You need
to step aside and just watch.

216
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,680
Thanks for coming, Takumi.

217
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,082
I'm counting on you.

218
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,351
<i>Yeah...</i>

219
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,553
I'm sorry that we kept you waiting.

220
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:11,164
Really! I'm tired of waiting!

221
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,228
You're pretty young...

222
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,697
What's your name'!

223
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:20,532
Takumi Fujiwara.

224
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,433
I'll remember your name.

225
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:24,369
I'm Keisuke Takahashi.

226
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,800
I won't make the same mistake twice.

227
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:35,079
Is it really all right'!

228
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,615
It's totally foolish to race
an Eight-Six against a FD.

229
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:39,250
There's a huge difference in horsepower,

230
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,251
and the FD is the best
domestic cornering machine.

231
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,123
Both in the straights and in the turns,

232
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,826
the Eight-Six is outclassed!

233
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,077
Wejust need to have faith in him...

234
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,439
Then we'll begin the countdown.

235
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:03,274
"Roger!
"Roger!

236
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,275
Ten seconds to green!

237
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,546
Nine! Eight!

238
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,049
Seven! Six!

239
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,050
Five! Four! Three!

240
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,055
Two! One!

241
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,056
Gog

242
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:46,282
Fast! Keisuke Takahashi': FD!

243
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,887
350 horses are no joke.

244
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,456
His shifting is perfect.

245
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,990
It's no match.

246
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,991
At full acceleration, the Eight-Six
looked like it was standing still.

247
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,429
Takumi...

248
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:03,733
<i>Coming off the line, that Eight-Six
has 150 horsepower at most.</i>

249
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,439
<i>It': not quite the monster
Keisuke was talking about.</i>

250
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,177
<i>The reason why it can shift so fast</i>

251
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:16,014
<i>is that it has tranny gears for a rally.</i>

252
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,015
<i>It must be perfect for the hairpins on Akina.</i>

253
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,619
<i>Still, there': no reason</i>

254
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,620
<i>Keisuke': FD would be beat out by it.</i>

255
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,458
<i>The monster isn't the car...</i>

256
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,561
<i>...but the driver?!</i>

257
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,806
<i>I won'! give him a break.</i>

258
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,074
<i>I don'! like using the
straightaway: to pull ahead,</i>

259
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,576
<i>but this is a timed run.</i>

260
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,857
<i>I'll never even see that
Eight-Six in my rearview mirror.</i>

261
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,354
What's that?!

262
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:32,355
This is the first corner! It's great!
The Eight-Six's line is incredible!

263
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:35,360
It wasn't more than 5 cm from the guardrail!

264
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,171
I've never seen anyone corner at that speed!

265
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,146
<i>What?!</i>

266
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,614
<i>He': closing the gap?!</i>

267
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,614
<i>Hex gelling closer?!</i>

268
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,353
<i>It must be my imagination!</i>

269
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,433
<i>It': impossible!</i>

270
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,204
Are... Are you serious?!

271
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:56,205
Takumi': father was once a great street racer'!

272
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,409
Yeah.

273
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,245
I've seen him several times,

274
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,215
but he's just the gruff owner of the tofu shop.

275
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,151
I guess you really can't tell much
about a person by just looking at them.

276
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,872
According to Mr. Tachibana, he's still
the fastest on the downhill in Akina.

277
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,558
Anyway, that's who sent Takumi in his place,

278
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,364
so we should just believe in Takumi.

279
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,266
Yeah... It's much better than if I had run.

280
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,267
But even if his father is fast, Takumi <i>is...</i>

281
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:29,672
It sounds like Takumi beat
Keisuke Takahashi once before.

282
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,577
What?!

283
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:36,618
Takumi defeated Keisuke Takahashi?! No way!

284
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,384
I can't believe it! That spacey Takumi?!

285
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,725
He didn't even know what an Eight-Six was!

286
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,573
What?! What's in that Eight-Six?!

287
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,209
At incredible speed, it came
in with the rear end free

288
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,179
and it passed through
at an unbelievable speed!

289
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,814
It wouldn't be surprising if it
went airborne at any moment!

290
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,815
We've got shivers going up our spines!

291
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,731
<i>He': caught up to me?!</i>

292
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,632
<i>What': happening? I must be going crazy!</i>

293
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,600
Up to second gear, they're the same,

294
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,569
but the stretch is different...

295
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,470
If the straight is even a
little long, he'll pull away...

296
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,119
This is the straightaway
in front of the skating rink.

297
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,820
The two of them just passed by!

298
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,789
He's on Keisuke': bumper!

299
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,458
Akina': Eight-Six is unbelievably fast!

300
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,760
Is this for real?!

301
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,570
Keisuke': FD has never had
anyone keep up with it this far!

302
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,768
Man, I've got goosebumps...

303
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,306
On this long straightaway,
Keisuke pulled away,

304
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,307
but after this, there are many
hairpins. It may be a problem!

305
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,446
Did you hear him, Ryosuke'!

306
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:50,481
We miscalculated...

307
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,352
We didn't know Akina had such a great driver...

308
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,889
Great attack!

309
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,890
That Eight-Six': attack was aggressive.
It was an incredible kamikaze technique!

310
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,810
He's got no sense of fear on the downhill.

311
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,166
<i>In the straights, Pm faster.</i>

312
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,002
<i>But he': caught up to me.</i>

313
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:46,604
<i>That means Pm losing in the comers.</i>

314
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:49,073
<i>To be caught by a less powerful car</i>

315
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,976
<i>is the ultimate shame for a street racer!</i>

316
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,227
<i>H! die before admitting that!</i>

317
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,920
<i>My old man...</i>

318
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:06,551
<i>Unless I pass that car,
he won't admit that I won...</i>

319
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,529
<i>There': no other way...
I guess! have to do that...</i>
