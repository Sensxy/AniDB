choice you should take</i>

<i>Safety is in lies, truth is empty</i>

12

<i>On the edge of danger,

13
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:57,956
<i>Now we gotta start let's get moved!</i>

14
00:00:57,957 --> 00:00:59,858
<i>Let': move into the brand new world</i>

15
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,094
<i>Let': dive into the brand new trip</i>

16
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,095
<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

17
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,865
<i>We've just begun, now we go
full speed and funky beat</i>

18
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,136
<i>We will shine around the world</i>

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,308
<i>Trip to the world
Yo! Here we go unknown world</i>

20
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,377
<i>We newborn travelers</i>

21
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,579
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,448
<i>The place you want to go is under your feet!</i>

23
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,783
<i>So many people in this world</i>

24
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,218
<i>It's not as if there isn't
backstabbing once in a while</i>

25
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,054
<i>Let': warp past these boring things</i>

26
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,555
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

27
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,556
<i>That': our law!</i>

28
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:40,464
<i>What': going on? Pm so tense I could die.</i>

29
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,835
<i>I wanna go to Mt. Akina so bad.</i>

30
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,072
<i>Pm not really sure if I love
driving that much, but...</i>

31
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:54,511
<i>For the past five years, come rain or snow,</i>

32
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:59,913
<i>I've driven Mt. Akina more often than anyone.</i>

33
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:11,194
Anyway, that's the story.
So I'm taking the car, Dad!

34
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,452
You'd better hurry, Takumi! It's almost time.

35
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,740
--It's him!
--He's here!

36
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:24,741
<i>Oh, no! They found me!</i>

37
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,913
It's too late to run.

38
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,994
<i>Pm dead!</i>

39
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:48,066
What the hell are you doing

40
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,936
sitting in the middle of the road, ltsuki'!

41
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:53,739
<i>Ta... Ta... Ta...</i>

42
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,460
Get out of my way! I'm gonna run you over.

43
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,412
Takumi!You came!

44
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,417
Yeah.

45
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,417
Sorry, ltsuki... for being late.

46
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:10,455
Takumi...!

47
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,456
A street racer should race
if he's challenged, right'!

48
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:18,165
Takumi...!

49
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,739
<i>Wait... don't...</i>

50
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:26,445
"Act 9: Battle to the Limit!"

51
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,064
<i>Jeez,he's young!</i>

52
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,065
<i>Bet he hasn'! even had his
license for more than a year!</i>

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,270
<i>Where'd a kid like this learn his technique?!</i>

54
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:07,066
<i>I thought for sure I'd be
facing a guy older than me!</i>

55
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,519
<i>So that': a GT-R...</i>

56
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,889
<i>It's beyond amazing.
That car's in a class by itself.</i>

57
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:25,033
<i>Its driving system combines everything
good about FR and four-wheel drive.</i>

58
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,899
I'm Nakazato... one of the Night Kids.

59
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,237
What's your name'!

60
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,740
Takumi Fujiwara.

61
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,476
I'll remember that.

62
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,757
What do you say we get started?

63
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,881
--Who do you think's gonna win?
“Nakazato, of course! --R32!

64
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,120
Now you tell me

65
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,121
that heavy understeer during full throttle
is the better setting if you have skills,

66
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,493
but if maneuverability is suddenly different,

67
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:57,494
don't you thinkTakumi's going to
panic when he charges into corners'!

68
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,631
Maybe you should've warned him...

69
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,270
It wouldn't have done any good.

70
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,271
He's not exactly a driver
who drives with his head.

71
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:13,176
What?! Then all the more reason to tell him!

72
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,448
It's all right.

73
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,550
You don't have to worry.

74
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,353
See, he might not be too sharp upstairs...

75
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,755
...but his body and his senses are finely tuned.

76
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,756
It's too late to think first and react

77
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,227
to the information you feel
on your back through the seat.

78
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,963
Your arms and legs have to move
unconsciously to control drifting.

79
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,566
That's why you don't need to worry!

80
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,402
He has this great sense of knowing
when and how to accelerate

81
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,037
while the car is drifting.

82
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,239
So even if the suspension
setting is a little different,

83
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,808
it won't matter to him in the least.

84
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,911
He'll make minor adjustments

85
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:46,879
and just ride it out.

86
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,159
See, the Eight-Six is a car that trains its driver.

87
00:05:58,424 --> 00:05:59,658
Here's the goal.

88
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:02,289
The road': clear of regular traffic,
so anytime you're ready...

89
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,732
IketanHWe can go anytime!

90
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:09,234
All right!

91
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,235
I'm gonna start the countdown!

92
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:14,438
Start in ten seconds.

93
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,281
Takumi! I'm counting on you!

94
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,253
Keisuke...

95
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:31,254
We're gonna have the best seats
in the house for tonight's battle!

96
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,892
Now hop in! They're about to start!

97
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,027
<i>S...</i>

98
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,962
<i>4... 3...</i>

99
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,297
2... 1...

100
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,298
Gog

101
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,074
The R32 is ahead!

102
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,735
Yeah, but Takumi': not too far behind!

103
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,312
Here they come!

104
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,195
Get your seat belt on!

105
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,926
Hey! That's the FC.
Ryosuke Takahashi just dashed out!

106
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,397
Is he trying to horn in on the race?!

107
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,398
What the hell...'!! Is it going
to be a three-way super battle'!

108
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:18,768
Suddenly, it's turned into a
race for the fastest in Gunma!

109
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,229
<i>The GT-R driver... He': slowing down...</i>

110
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,124
<i>Is he waiting for me?!</i>

111
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,125
<i>It'd be a waste to lose
him on the straightaway.</i>

112
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,263
<i>I wanna have a battle here!</i>

113
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:48,304
<i>The real starting line comes
as soon as we hit the first comer!</i>

114
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,710
Hey, look at that!

115
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,513
Nakazato': easing up on the gas
and waiting for the Eight-Six!

116
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,048
Hope his overconfidence

117
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:05,329
doesn't end up costing him
in the last half of the race!

118
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,921
Here they come!

119
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:12,992
The first corner... and all
three cars, taking it in a row!

120
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:27,437
<i>Wow! Just like Buma said!</i>

121
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,242
What the hell...'!!

122
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,777
No way, mister!

123
00:08:31,777 --> 00:08:34,045
Pulling stunts like that

124
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,266
ain't gonna get you caught up to me!

125
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,680
Getting to eyeball it from this close up...

126
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,681
That drift looks just like a work of art!

127
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,984
A four-wheel drift in full throttle, and
he's barely applying the countersteer!

128
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,323
Do you realize how incredible that is?!

129
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,324
He's pushing that Eight-Six to its outer limits

130
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,061
and controlling it like it was
his own hands and feet!

131
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,398
Even I can't control the FC like that!

132
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,836
It's exciting!

133
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,827
Yeah, maybe, but little by little,
Nakazato is gaining ground!

134
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,063
Can the Eight-Six win this one?!

135
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,751
<i>Yes! This is it!</i>

136
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,752
<i>It': like I can feel the blood
rushing through my veins!</i>

137
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,223
<i>This is the battle I've been waiting for!</i>

138
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,226
<i>Ready, boy? I'm really gonna cut loose now!</i>

139
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,226
<i>Let': see how far you can keep up!</i>

140
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,877
<i>Hgy...</i>

141
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:14,877
<i>Something': different...
Something': different with the car!</i>

142
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,749
<i>Even if I floor the gas,
the car doesn't lose control.</i>

143
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,750
<i>Does this mean I can step on
the gas sooner than before?</i>

144
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,621
<i>When I was at work today,
did Dad fiddle with it?!</i>

145
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:26,958
<i>'Cause it sure wasn't like this</i>

146
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,461
<i>when I made the deliveries this morning!</i>

147
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,063
<i>Now! get it!</i>

148
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:34,063
<i>That': why he was out before!
He was working on this!</i>

149
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,767
<i>Don'! know why...</i>

150
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,136
<i>Bu! anyway, it does feel
a whole lot better this way!</i>

151
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:41,387
<i>Because it doesn't slide too much...
I can push it all the way!</i>

152
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,183
“Yow!
"Amazing!

153
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,204
That's some un-freakin'-believable drifting!

154
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,700
That's the first time I've seen a guy
drift all the way through that corner!

155
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,905
Yeah, he's nuts!

156
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,895
He'd never be able to do it if he didn't
have total mastery over his speed!

157
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,810
What the heck was that?!

158
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,546
That's no kind of drift I've ever seen before!

159
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,049
Incredible! That's drifting I'll never forget!

160
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,050
Man, oh, man!

161
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:53,676
The Eight-Six is still on the R32': tail!

162
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:55,781
He's doing it!

163
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,349
Looks like Takumi': sticking
right behind the R32!

164
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,851
Mind-blowing!

165
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,386
I mean, Nakazato': an ace...

166
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,722
Line him up with Ryosuke
Takahashi, another superstar,

167
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,723
and you got a battle royal brewing already!

168
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,728
And my best friend's racing against
both of 'em?! Unbelievable!

169
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,729
I mean, that is too cool!

170
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,434
Well, yeah, but...

171
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,434
...Ryosuke Takahashi and his
FC aren't even in the race.

172
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,971
He's acting more like a third-person witness.

173
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,274
Right.Takumi's up against Nakazato here.

174
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,279
His R32 has the Eight-Six at a disadvantage...

175
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,749
But with Takumi at the wheel,
the Eight Six'll pull through in the end!

176
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,784
Oh, yeah.Takumi will take it, for sure!

177
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,925
Right, guys!

178
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,240
He's creeping further and further away!

179
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,475
Nakazato': got a big mouth,

180
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,477
but it looks like he's got
the skill to back it up!

181
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,413
Look at how he distributes the load,

182
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,215
subduing the understeer while driving!

183
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,918
He really knows how to
draw out the GT-R': power.

184
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,620
Not pretty to look at...

185
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,922
This is not the time to take it easy.

186
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,424
Hey, bro...

187
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:14,893
Whose side are you on, anyway?!

188
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,894
If the kid loses this one, it's all over!

189
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:20,098
The real contest is only about to begin.

190
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,700
The first half has comparatively
more long straightaways...

191
00:13:22,701 --> 00:13:24,369
Lots of gentle slopes, too.

192
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,771
There are lots of
disadvantages for the Eight-Six.

193
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,240
But the inclines are gonna start
getting rougher right around here.

194
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:32,371
Perfect for a downhill
specialist to strut his stuff!

195
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,729
<i>All right! This kind of low-gear hairpin curve</i>

196
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,998
<i>is right up the R32': alley!</i>

197
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,339
<i>All I gotta do is cut my speed
by slamming on the brakes...</i>

198
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,041
<i>Going downhill, like it or not, the from'.
wheels still have to bear the load,</i>

199
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:08,611
<i>so its weakest point, the pushing
understeer, hardly occurs.</i>

200
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:11,082
<i>Furthermore, accelerating from a low gear</i>

201
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:14,083
<i>is what this car does better than any other!</i>

202
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,588
<i>The fastest machine on the racing circuit...</i>

203
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,589
<i>...is the toughest machine even on open roads!</i>

204
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,428
<i>The R emblem on the rear</i>

205
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,930
<i>is the legendary symbol for invincibility!</i>

206
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,271
<i>Can you get close enough to read it?!</i>

207
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,109
Hey, lketani...

208
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,477
What'!

209
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,477
I've been thinking.

210
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,381
'Till now, I thought Takumi

211
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,283
was just a unique racer

212
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,284
who's fast only when he's racing on Akina.

213
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,788
But if he raced on a different mountain pass,

214
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,124
how well would he drive?

215
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,626
Don't you wonder about that'!

216
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,627
Well, sure, I've mulled it over...

217
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,999
But right now, all I'm thinking
about is the battle at hand!

218
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,601
Win,Takumi!

219
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,601
Takumi!

220
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,121
<i>Oh, man!</i>

221
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,122
<i>My eyes can'! keep up with him!</i>

222
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,228
<i>Looks like he': finally kicking out the jams!</i>

223
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,189
<i>His inside tires are gripping the rim of the road!</i>

224
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,136
<i>This is the one! The trick that I lost to!</i>

225
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,532
<i>Didn't think I'd ever get
the chance to see it again!</i>

226
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,151
<i>Ryosuke': stopped with the chatter.</i>

227
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:56,087
<i>Meaning there': no time for that now?</i>

228
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,723
<i>I've ridden shotgun with him tons of times...</i>

229
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:01,724
<i>But this is the first time I've
seen him driving like this!</i>

230
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,329
<i>I've never seen him so serious!</i>

231
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:04,897
<i>"Akina Skate Center"
I've never seen him so serious!</i>

232
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,897
"Akina Skate Center"

233
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,672
<i>Getting closer...?!</i>

234
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,041
<i>The Eight-Six is catching up to me?!</i>

235
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,042
<i>Impossible!</i>

236
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,241
<i>Brilliant! Catching up to me after all that...</i>

237
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,313
<i>All my prejudices about the
Eight-Six being a 10-year-old car</i>

238
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,982
<i>have just been blown away!</i>

239
00:16:56,982 --> 00:17:00,202
<i>It': a first-rate fighting machine!</i>

240
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,189
<i>Okay, the kid gloves are off!</i>

241
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,925
<i>Man, this is the best rush I've had in ages!</i>

242
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,762
<i>In fact, this has gotta be the
hottest road race I've been in</i>

243
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,763
<i>since getting this car!</i>

244
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,604
<i>When it comes to hairpin turns,</i>

245
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:56,574
<i>he can'! match the R32!</i>

246
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,609
<i>No matter how close the
Eight-Six sticks to the R32,</i>

247
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,610
<i>the distance between them
always widens after a hairpin!</i>

248
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,982
<i>Man, that Nakazato': got guts, too...</i>

249
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,882
<i>Attacking the road like that,
downhill in a heavy-ass R32!</i>

250
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,763
<i>Wha-What than?!</i>

251
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,534
<i>The Eight-Six closed the gap
at the high-speed comer?!</i>

252
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,737
<i>Going over 100 kilometers an hour
while doing a four-wheel drift</i>

253
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:04,375
<i>close enough to graze the guardrail?!</i>

254
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,376
<i>I don'! think any of it has to do
with the car's capabilities!</i>

255
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,313
<i>That guy... has got a screw loose!</i>

256
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,817
<i>If he makes one slip-up, he': roadkill for sure!</i>

257
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,989
<i>But now! understand his secret!</i>

258
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,558
<i>With a lightweight like the
Eight-Six, if he loses speed once,</i>

259
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,558
<i>it takes like forever to get it back up again.</i>

260
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,061
<i>He never lets himself lose a fraction
of speed more than he has to!</i>

261
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,266
<i>Now I finally get why,</i>

262
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,935
<i>when I raced against him,</i>

263
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:33,365
<i>he could always catch up to me,
no matter how many times! lost him!</i>

264
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,343
<i>Crap!</i>

265
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,973
<i>I can'! shake him!</i>

266
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,107
<i>Just the opposite!</i>

267
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:12,107
<i>He': hanging on to me for
longer and longer periods!</i>

268
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,694
<i>The bastard... is tough!</i>

269
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,461
<i>Nakazato': clearing the guardrail
by a good 20-30 centimeters.</i>

270
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,234
<i>No matter how fast you are,</i>

271
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,236
<i>that': about right.</i>

272
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,770
<i>Yet the Eight-Six': bumper</i>

273
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,771
<i>is almost close enough
to the rail to make sparks!</i>

274
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,410
<i>That guy': in a league of his own!</i>

275
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,541
<i>How?! How can he control a drift
with that kind of precision?!</i>

276
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,362
<i>Since I've been steering
hard and using the ABS,</i>

277
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,100
<i>the load on the front tires has
been a lot heavier than I thought!</i>

278
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,715
<i>This race is suddenly getting
much more challenging!</i>

279
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,167
The five hairpins are coming up...

280
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:48,604
That's where he left you in the dust.

281
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,584
And I bet that's gonna be
a key point this time, too.

282
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,484
<i>An R32 versus an Eight-Six...</i>

283
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,787
<i>Who would've thought the
battle would be this fierce?</i>

284
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:05,056
<i>Both of those cars are
being taken to their limits.</i>

285
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,057
<i>Bu! which one of them
is gonna take the prize?!</i>

286
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:19,138
I'm at the hairpins! And I can hear 'em coming!

287
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,497
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

288
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,566
<i>$0 HO one IHTQFVQHQS</i>

289
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,101
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

290
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,169
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

291
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,971
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

292
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,173
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

293
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,642
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

294
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,077
<i>'Cuz Pm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

295
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,078
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

296
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,949
<i>You tried to escape,
but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

297
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,019
<i>Something is within your grasp
and something is forgotten</i>

298
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,023
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

299
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,961
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

300
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,035
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

301
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

302
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,415
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

303
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,416
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

304
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,555
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

305
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,094
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

306
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,096
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

307
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,298
<i>Reverberations left behind,
