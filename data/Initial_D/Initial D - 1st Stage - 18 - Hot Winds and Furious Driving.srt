00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,340
<i>crashing into a wall or falling off a cliff.</i>

50
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,460
No wonder people are talking
about that Eight-Six lately.

51
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,098
We can't shake him off easily.

52
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:37,579
He is about to experience the
terror of Usui': severe turns.

53
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,925
--Narrow right turn ahead!
--Okay!

54
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,487
<i>She': fast! Damn!</i>

55
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,598
<i>But I gotta stay close!</i>

56
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,269
<i>If she can, I can!</i>

57
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:16,272
Takumi said that if she could make
it around the corners, so could he.

58
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,180
That's exactly what he said.

59
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:25,181
That's an unbelievably childish idea.

60
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,518
What's wrong with his head'!

61
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,688
But it's amazing that he said that.

62
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,191
Someone with lesser abilities
wouldn't think that.

63
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,830
He can probably control his run

64
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,166
if he doesn't go beyond his limitations.

65
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,368
Of course he can!

66
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,871
But he's racing against Mako,

67
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,872
who knows everything there is
to know about this course.

68
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,709
I'm sure she enters each
corner as fast as possible

69
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:56,212
so Takumi will have to do the same,

70
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,936
even though he knows
nothing about this course.

71
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:04,687
I get chills just thinking about it.

72
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,292
Yeah, it demands both
technique and true courage.

73
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,066
One mistake...

74
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,676
...and he's finished.

75
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,846
<i>He': racing a Sileighty...</i>

76
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:32,219
<i>What the heck is that?</i>

77
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,535
He's right behind me!

78
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,208
Why'! Am I not going fast enough?

79
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,110
<i>No,you're doing great, Make.</i>

80
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:00,846
But he's on me!

81
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,847
Don't worry about him,
or you'll mess up your rhythm.

82
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,450
Leave what's going on behind us to me.

83
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,189
It's only just started.

84
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:13,189
Let's enjoy this awesome race!

85
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,860
Right. I trust you.

86
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,297
Just believe in your partner!

87
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,928
You and I are the fastest team in Usui!

88
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,109
If the mouse gets away, it's over.

89
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,110
If not, we keep switching
positions until someone wins.

90
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:38,615
It's a "sudden-death death match."

91
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:41,718
With this rule, you should go in front first.

92
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:45,323
It won't end with one race,

93
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,292
but at least you get one practice.

94
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,923
It's better to lose in the second race.

95
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,001
I'll chase her first.

96
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,670
Think it over,Takumi!

97
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,541
This is my race, so let me decide.

98
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,248
<i>Pm in trouble.</i>

99

<i>I chose to chase her 'cuzl didn't

100
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,086

I can win even at Akina Pass.</i>

00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,319
Maybe it's over.

126
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,989
It's not over until they come back.

127
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,990
This race is one-sided,

Nakazato': R32 was monstrous.

And the duct tape death match
was Takumi': first try.

132
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:56,112
But Takumi always had one friend...

133
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:59,172
Akina Pass.

134
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,620
The pass that he drove every day for years.

135
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:08,257
Does the location make that
much difference, though?

136
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,831
If he had driven here a few times,

137
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,752
it might have been different,
but this is his very first time here.

What the heck was that girl
doing sitting next to Mako'!

141

How should I know'!

142
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:36,788
I noticed that, too.

143
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,789
This is a race, but she
went in as if it was normal.

144
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,460
I don't know the details.

145
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,365
All I know is that they're best friends,

146
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:50,366
and from the beginning,
they were always analyzing

147
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,513
and developing their technique together.

148
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Isn't she like a rally navigator?

149
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,217
--That makes it worse for Takumi.
--Yeah.

150

No way! He won't lose!

151

But with a good navigator,

152
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:20,022

00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,007
We'll shake him off there!

160
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,843
We'll drift from the very beginning.

161
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,314
Let's show him what we're made of

162
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,315
at Usui': most difficult turn.

163
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:48,520
Got it.That's right!

164
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I'll show him how drifting should be done!

165
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,921
No one else has ever
cleared the turn at full speed.

166
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,221
<i>Are Make and Sayuki here tonight'!?</i>

167
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,222
I haven't seen them yet.

168
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,959
I wanna see the Sileighty': drift.

169
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,062
Here at C-121 is the best place for it.

170
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:36,001
'Cuz it's really hard.

171
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,169
It's the hardest.

172
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,170
You're considered an advanced racer here

173
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,175
if you can drift through this turn.

174
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,176
Advanced in Usui means the best anywhere.

175
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,346
--Yeah. --If you don't have
the courage to come in fast,

176
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,650
you won't have enough
speed to drift to the end.

177
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:58,854
All the first-timers mess it up.

178
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:02,194
But some can actually do it, right'!

179
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,862
A few.

180
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,862
But only Mako': Sileighty
does it at full speed.

181
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,568
I don't know how fast she goes,

182
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,349
but no one else has managed it yet.

183
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,047
Someone is coming down.

184
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,658
Hear that squealing? They're coming in fast!

185
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:30,856
There!

186
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,691
--The Sileighty!
--It's Mako and Sayuki!

187
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,860
Who's following them'!

188
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:37,861
Are they racing?!

189
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,632
An Eight-Six?!

190
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,450
No cars ahead!

191
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,984
<i>Make 'W. flashy, Make!</i>

192
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,985
--Yeah!
--Go!

193
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,262
They're in the turn!

194
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:29,011
That fool came into the turn
at the same speed as Mako!

195
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,315
Doesn't he know how difficult C-121 is?!

196
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,932
Courage alone won't let him clear the corner!

197
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,129
<i>He has guts, following Make into this comer.</i>

198
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,367
<i>But at this speed, there': no turning back.</i>

199
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:56,005
<i>C-121's exit narrows severely.</i>

200
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,010
<i>There is only one ideal line to the exit,
though there seem to be others.</i>

201
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:07,402
Can you find it, your first time on this course?

202
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,460
He couldn't have!

203
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,723
--He cleared it.
--Unbelievable.

204
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,025
Who's that Eight-Six'!

205
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,026
Could he be... the famous
Eight-Six of Mount Akina'!

206
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,051
I have goose bumps!

207
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,872
<i>Whatjust happened?</i>

208
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,508
<i>Four-wheel drift at full speed</i>

209
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,010
<i>is ranked as "Ultra D" difficulty.</i>

210
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,011
<i>Even Make missed the
ideal line by three inches.</i>

211
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:14,856
<i>But he was right on it.</i>

212
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:28,512
<i>We can'! win. We chose a
monster as our opponent.</i>

213
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,816
No! You can't swing that much here!

214
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,754
You couldn't have told me that sooner?

215
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,324
What's wrong'! Focus! This isn't like you!

216
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,230
Can't you tell, Mako'!

217
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,231
That Eight-Six is unreal.

218
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,267
He's way out of our league.

219
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:09,273
What happened to your usual stubbornness?

220
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,274
It's not even over and you're giving up'!

221
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:15,112
Not me!

222
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,782
I guess I am...

223
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,783
Fine! I didn't know you were a quitter.

224
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,130
I'll do it myself!

225
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,163
We already knew how great he was.

226
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,160
But since this is my last race...

227
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,838
...we can't quit without giving it our best!

228
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,677
What are you, scared?!

229
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,846
You're useless!

230
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,716
You're nothing but dead weight.

231
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:53,652
--Dead weight?!
--You're freight,

232
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,520
messing up the power-to-weight ratio!

233
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,523
<i>She gets tough behind the wheel!</i>

234
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,891
I'm not freight!

235
00:21:00,892 --> 00:21:03,892
I'm not fat! I have a nice body!

236
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,664
Forty-nine kilograms of extra weight!

237
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:08,745
I weigh 47!

238
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:13,279
Fine, I've got my pride, too!

239
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,575
<i>Ready, Make'!</i>

240
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,578
We'll put our lives on the line!

241
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,479
Welcome back!

242
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,480
All right. Enter the next turn so
you almost scrape the inside wall!

243
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,251
Got it!

244
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,937
<i>Not bad.</i>

245
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,778
<i>I improved while recklessly chasing her.</i>

246
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,185
<i>I can feel the rhythm now!</i>

247
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,186
<i>Pm synched in!</i>

248
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,525
<i>Not many comers left now...</i>

249
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,526
<i>I'll just have to attack
each comer as well as I can!</i>

250
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,598
<i>I want no regrets.</i>

251
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,619
<i>My pride as Usui's fastest is on the line.</i>

252
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,553
<i>Ai ni tsukare hate samayotteta koro</i>

253
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,392
<i>Yokubou duke ni kararete miushinatteita</i>

254
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,233
<i>Kimagure nu unmeiwa</i>

255
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:01,349
<i>Mujaki nu hitomi ni miserarete yuku</i>

256
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,648
<i>Sake bum no you ni akaku
tsuyoku, tsuyoku kimi o daite</i>

257
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,188
<i>Talia hitotsu kono omoi o shinjitsu da to ieru</i>

258
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,995
<i>Yorokobi o kanadeyou...</i>

259
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:28,407
<i>Kagayaku mirai e</i>

260
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,219
<i>Kazoe kirenai hodo tashikame aou</i>

261
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,894
<i>Jounetsu yo eien e todoke</i>

262
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,966
<i>Sake bum no you ni akaku

263
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
<i>Tatoe nani o ushinattemo

264

<i>Utsukushiku karen ni sake...</i>

265
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:19,318
<i>Kiseki no hana yo</i>

266
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,565
<i>Buma, do you thinkTakumi has
a chance against the Sileighty?</i>

267
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,537
<i>--Who knows?
--Who knows?!</i>

268
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,537
<i>I sell tofu, not predictions.</i>

269
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,674
<i>--I'll have Gunmo and Atsuage.
--I have seasoned that Eight-Six.</i>

270
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,745
<i>No one can touch it downhill.</i>

271
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,514
<i>It': up to the driver.</i>

272
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,616
<i>We'll see next week.</i>

273
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,352
<i>What if! bought Momen and KinugoshLtoo?</i>

274
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:51,353
<i>Next on initial D: "Super Drift."</i>

275
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,876
<i>--It's a must-see.
"Don't miss it!</i>
