00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,975
What?!

23
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,874
No way! He passed Takeshi easily.

24
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,960
That Evo IV is good!

25
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,681
Takeshi': R32 fell behind.

26
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:32,117
The Evo IV seems to be pulling away.

27
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,919
<i>What them'!</i>

28
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,960
What the heck is that Ian-Evo thinking?

29
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,960
<i>Against a skilled Myogi racer,</i>

30
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:44,961
<i>he chose to be in front, which is unfavorable.</i>

31
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,932
<i>Confidence?</i>

32
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:49,103
<i>Or is he just an idiot?</i>

33
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,215
This race is just starting!

34
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,923
Big brother, are you in there?

35
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:09,697
What is it, Keisuke'!

36
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,324
The Ian-Evo team is racing at Mt. Myogi.

37
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,395
I just got the news.

38
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,897
Against the Night Kids' Nakazato'!

39
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:20,999
I suppose.

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,400
Who's going to win, big brother?

41
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:29,072
Just this once, I'm rooting for Nakazato to win.

42
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,490
The Len-Eve's vulgar spoiler
makes me want to puke.

43
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:39,349
Nakazato': strength lies in his boldness

44
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,419
and his offensive driving method.

45
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,624
When he's on, he's fast,

46
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,905
but he tends to crack under pressure.

47
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,629
I sure hope he's recovered

48
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,806
from the loss he suffered against you.

49
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,814
<i>This isn't happening!
But the race is far from over!</i>

50
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:14,753
<i>If! don't stop them...</i>

51
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,154
<i>...who will?!</i>

52
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,689
Damn it!

53
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,702
We get your team sticker, as promised.

54
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:49,853
In no time, my Evo lV's spoiler will be covered

55
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:53,089
with the torn stickers of
all the teams in Gunma.

56
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,462
Don't start celebrating yet!

57
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,463
There are many fast racers in Gunma!

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,800
That sounds to me like
the pathetic cry of a loser.

59
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,071
--Let's go, Seiji.
--Yeah.

60
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,075
By the way...

61
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,076
...from now on, you pull
over whenever you see

62
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,973
a car with the Emperor sticker on it.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,890
Takeshi... I still can't believe he was
faster than you in an uphill battle.

64
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,508
The Ian-Evo team defeated the Night Kids.

65
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,013
What'! Seriously?

66
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,014
That's all anyone': talking about this morning.

67
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,684
Nakazato': R32 crashed into a wall
and suffered severe damage.

68
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,056
That's tragic.

69
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,225
Things have been rough
for the Night Kids lately.

70
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:03,028
I feel bad for them.

71
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,831
I heard that the Ian-Evo squad is planning

72
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,832
to conquer Gunma within a month.

73
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,168
I'm sure they'll come to Akina, too.

74
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,240
What do we do if they come here?!

75
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,241
We have no choice but to face them.

76
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,244
We're Akina': team, so if they challenge us,

77
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:24,249
I have no intention of running away.

78
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,718
I've already switched my 513's tires

79
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,720
to ones with better grip.

80
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,022
I informed the team members already.

81
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,692
Thank you very much.

82
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:35,660
Takumi.

83
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:38,661
They may specifically challenge
you to a downhill battle,

84
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,749
but you can just ignore them.

85
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:46,269
Your undefeated streak is our pride.

86
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,906
I'd hate to ruin it against a Ian-Evo.

87
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,109
You're not officially a Speed Star, either.

88
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,280
I want you to keep winning, too.

89
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,684
The Ian-Evo is no joke.

90
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:02,685
It's like racing against a WRC rally car.

91
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:06,723
Its light body is equipped
with turbo and 4WD.

92
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:10,495
It has no real weaknesses.

93
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,496
That car shouldn't be allowed on any pass.

94
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,233
<i>I hate to...</i>

95
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,504
I hate to avoid a race.

96
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,785
I want to race them, too.

97
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,746
Takumi, you sound like a true racer now!

98
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,983
You're my true friend! I love it!

99
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,922
I'm positive you'll win!

100
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,923
The Ian-Evo is going down!

101
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,161
Is that wise'!

102
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:46,162
Right now, his chance of winning <i>is...</i>

103
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,733
...zero percent.

104
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:48,900
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"
...zero percent.

105
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,981
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

106
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:55,040
Upgrading the Eight-Six'!

107
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,041
That came out of nowhere, Yuichi.

108
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,277
I'm sure it's crossed your mind.

109
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:04,714
Since Takumi is evolving into a fine racer,

110
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,385
I feel like it's about time to upgrade

111
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,336
the Eight-Six': capabilities to match his needs.

112
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,559
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not telling you what to do.

113
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,233
I just want to know your plans.

114
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:24,234
I guess this engine is getting old,

115
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,239
and it's about time to overhaul it.

116
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:30,809
Yeah.

117
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,245
Actually...

118
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,746
...I have one already.

119
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,248
What'!

120
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,983
Is that true'!

121
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,984
Yeah, I happened to get an incredible thing

122
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,755
from an unlikely source.

123
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,324
An incredible thing?

124
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:49,325
All right, I'll show it to you. Get in the car.

125
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,510
You'll get chills.

126
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,492
"Suzuki Motors"

127
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:09,212
This is incredible!This is gold!

128
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,384
You got chills, didn't you'!

129
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,385
More than that. It blew me away!

130
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,721
How did you manage to get this'!

131
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,991
I'm already psyched about the
idea of this in the Eight-Six.

132
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,029
Me, too.

133
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,665
I haven't felt this excited in a while.

134
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,666
It's almost too good forTakumi, isn't it'!

135
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,782
When are you putting it in'!

136
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,007
We'll see.

137
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,008
A better engine won't
automatically make the car better.

138
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,646
I'll need to adjust many things
and fine-tune the "footwork."

139
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,017
With the right balance,
it'll be an incredible machine.

140
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:52,021
I'll test it myself and come up
with the best configuration.

141
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,027
I'll need your help then, Masashi.

142
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,028
No problem, but you're so darn stubborn.

143
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,398
You never compromise.

144
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,670
This is like the old days.

145
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,772
But there is one more thing

146
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,373
Takumi hasn't accomplished in that car.

147
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,812
What is that'!

148
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,016
Nothing, really.

149
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,785
Stop teasing and tell us.

150
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,786
I'll tell you, but you have to promise me

151
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,560
not to tell Takumi about this.

152
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,295
We won't tell him.

153
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,296
Then I'll tell you.

154
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,479
That one thing <i>is...</i>

155
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,989
...losing a race.

156
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,578
What do you mean'!

157
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,579
Takumi has tried so hard
to remain undefeated.

158
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:53,084
That's what I don't like.

159
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,819
As long as he's winning,

160
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
he won't have a true
appreciation for this upgrade.

161
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,958
He needs to push the car's
capabilities to the very limit

162
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,396
and find out that it's still
not good enough to win.

163
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,234
There's a lesson to be learned

164
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:11,375
in that humiliation.

165
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,842
Until he loses...

166
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,533
...I can't upgrade the Eight-Six.

167
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,968
At this rate,

168
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:46,969
the side of the spoiler
will be covered in no time.

169
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,440
It's kind of fun if I think of it as a game.

170
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,310
But I wanna race more capable racers.

171
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,980
Where's our next target, Kyoichi'!

172
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,751
Tomorrow night, we'll head to Akina.

173
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:06,168
Akina': Eight-Six... how boring!

174
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,062
I don't mind doing it myself, Seiji.

175
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,330
What'!

176
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,331
Kyoichi will race him'! Why'!

177
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,335
I don't know.

178
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,370
Our ultimate target...

179
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:22,371
...is Ryosuke Takahashi of the Akagi Red Suns.

180
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:26,745
But before that, we'll defeat Akina': Eight-Six.

181
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,049
I went to see the course yesterday.

182
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,018
The slope is severe.

183
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,221
My Evo Ill is lighter and better suited for it.

184
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:39,222
You kidding me'! Let me take him, Kyoichi.

185
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,626
No matter where I race, I won't lose to anyone.

186
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,864
There is only one car that
my Evo IV can't beat, Kyoichi.

187
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,327
It's your Evo Ill.

188
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,075
Team Emperor's ace is not
needed against an Eight-Six.

189
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,410
I'll do it.

190
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,760
What's this'!

191
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,664
"Do you know that Natsuki Mogi

192
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:24,235
is dating an older man
in a Mercedes for money?"

193
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,872
"...Natsuki Mogi..."

194
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:28,953
"...dating..."

195
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:34,018
Takumi!

196
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,115
--Ready to go'!
--Yeah.

197
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,619
What do you have there?

198
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,430
It's nothing.

199
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:49,861
Hey,Takumi'!

200
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,530
This car magazine I bought recently

201
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,366
has a feature article on the Evo IV,

202
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,602
so maybe you should read it.

203
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:00,603
You may be battling against one.

204
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,474
No, thanks.

205
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,475
Why'! I'm sure it'll be very helpful.

206
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,912
I probably wouldn't know what to do

207
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:13,216
with the knowledge after reading the article.

208
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,819
How can I drive the Eight-Six faster'!

209
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,490
That's all I think about.

210
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,711
It doesn't matter which car I go up against.

211
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:30,945
Haven't you ever considered getting
a more powerful engine or something?

212
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,008
Not really.

213
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,489
Seriously? I'm dying for more
power for my Eight-Five!

214
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,257
A more powerful engine...

215
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,283
I have no clue.

216
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,485
--Takumi!
"What's going on, lketani'!

217
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,323
They're coming to Akina.

218
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,943
Tonight.

219
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,920
Here comes the Ian-Evo squad!

220
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,108
This will be an incredible battle.

221
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,164
Here they come! The Ian-Evo squad!

222
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,535
That white Evo IV in front must be the one

223
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:13,471
that defeated Nakazato in Myogi.

224
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,572
Rumor has it that he's ridiculously fast.

225
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:31,754
I knew it! The guys I met at Akina Lake!

226
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,525
So you're the Speed Stars.

227
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,526
I'm Sudo, the leader of Team Emperor.

228
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,664
I'm sure you already know
that we have only one demand.

229
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,837
A downhill race against your Eight-Six.

230
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,339
That's all.

231
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,340
We'll accept all your demands.

232
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:55,111
Any number of races, of any type,
under any conditions.

233
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,215
But if you fail to win even one race,

234
00:17:00,786 --> 00:17:03,786
we'll take your team sticker. Understood?

235
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,390
Our sticker?

236
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:08,391
--What are they gonna do with it'!
--No idea.

237
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:11,394
--It's okay, right'!
--We accept.

238
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,630
Then let's get right to the race.

239
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,136
We don't have much time.

240
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:21,137
The first race is the main downhill race.

241
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,674
Have your Eight-Six ready.

242
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:26,644
Who's racing for you'!

243
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,515
I am, and I drive an Evo IV.

244
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,155
Iketani, they said they were
ready for more than one race...

245
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,359
...so who's racing after Takumi'!

246
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,695
IfTakumi loses, I'll race next.

247
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,332
If he can beat Takumi, I sure
won't be able to beat him...

248
00:17:52,037 --> 00:17:55,037
...but we can't accept defeat without a fight.

249
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,932
Then I'll race after you.

250
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,679
We've been relying on Takumi too much lately.

251
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,450
Let's show him that we're capable, too!

252
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,253
Yeah!

253
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,618
I'm counting on you, our leadoff man!

254
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,780
Go get him!

255
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,470
Here comes Fujiwara Tofu Shop!

256
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,873
The Eight-Six vs. the Evo IV!

257
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,747
Good luck, Gunma': downhill hero!

258
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:48,092
Don't take this lightly, Seiji.

259
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:51,028
Go with "Simulation 3."

260
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,698
What'! Are you serious?

261
00:18:53,699 --> 00:18:56,699
"Simulation 3" against an Eight-Six'!

262
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,370
That's right.

263
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,371
<i>I can tell. I felt his energy.</i>

264
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,509
<i>This Eight-Six is capable. He': not a fake.</i>

265
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,346
<i>He has something that
made him defeat Ryosuke.</i>

266
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,449
<i>Until we know what it is,
we can't let our guard down.</i>

267
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,786
I'll count down.

268
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,787
No, no need for that.

269
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:22,124
This is a race, not a time trial.

270
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,128
The one with less engine power
can start whenever he likes.

271
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,633
The other starts accordingly.

272
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,703
We'll start late,

273
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:35,704
but that's our handicap for
having more horsepower.

274
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:38,974
We call it the "Handicap Method."

275
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:41,479
What do you say'!

276
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,730
If it's okay with you, Takumi.

277
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,487
<i>I saw him once by Akina Lake.</i>

278
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,191
<i>It never occurred to me
that a young kid like him</i>

279
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,161
<i>was the driver of Akina': Eight-Six.</i>

280
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,233
<i>Kyoichi has developed three strategies to win</i>

281
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,002
<i>on an opponent': course.</i>

282
00:20:05,003 --> 00:20:08,003
<i>"Simulation 3" is only used
against the toughest opponents,</i>

283
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:12,908
<i>so why use it against this Eight-Six?</i>

284
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,262
<i>I don'! get it.</i>

285
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,054
Takumi zoomed out!

286
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,135
Go,Takumi!

287
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:40,571
I won't show you how great the Evo IV <i>is...</i>

288
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,502
...but how incredible I am!
