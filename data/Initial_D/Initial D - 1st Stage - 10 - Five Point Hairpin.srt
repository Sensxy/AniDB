I'm staying inside too much.</i>

74
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,752
<i>One car width should be enough
to keep him away from the inside.</i>

<i>and snuck inside while braking!</i>

85

<i>The Eight-Six can perform tricks like that?!</i>

86

<i>But the race isn't over yet.</i>

87
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,092

90
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,862

91
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,863

<i>No... l lost the race.</i>

93
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,942
<i>My R32 didn't lose to that Eight-Six.</i>

94
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,634
<i>I never thought racers like that existed.</i>

95
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,124

96
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,125
<i>...but somehow! feel satisfied,</i>

<i>because I gave it my best.</i>

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,402
<i>Dam...</i>

99
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,242
Another 70,000 yen to fix this.

100
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:04,757
I'll train harder and try again.

101
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:11,838
Takumi won the race! He did it!

102
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,719
Guys, he did it!

103
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,356
--Takumi won the race!
--Yeah...

104
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,994
I can't believe it!

105
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,994
The Eight-Six passed the
R32 on the fourth hairpin!

106
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:28,525
How can an Eight-Six beat a R32'!

107
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,009
--That Eight-Six won'!
--| still can't believe it!

108
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,415
<i>You were right, Bun ta.</i>

109
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,416
<i>You called it.</i>

110
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,922
Wasn't that fun and educational, Keisuke'!

111
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,226
Yeah, that move the
Eight-Six used was amazing.

112
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,100
He faked going outside

113
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,790
and snuck inside while braking fully.

114
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:10,073
He must have great ABS.

115
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,277
You don't get it, do you, Keisuke'!

116
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,313
The Eight-Six doesn't come with ABS.

117
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,051
<i>But...</i>

118
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,051
That Eight-Six has human ABS.

119
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:26,222
Street racers who only drive cars with ABS

120
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,428
can't learn the strict pedal control

121
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,429
required to stop just before the brakes lock.

122
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:36,733
After all, ABS can't outperform the right foot

123
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:41,213
of a highly experienced driver like him.

124
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,942
It's been a while since I got that into a race.

125
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:51,692
That Eight-Six is a worthy target for us.

126
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,782
What are you staring at it for'!

127
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:28,435
Nothing...

128
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:35,737
Hey, Dad, this car...

129
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,167
What about it'!

130
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,130
Nothing... never mind.

131
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,659
I'm going to bed.

132
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,578
What'! How'!

133
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,912
I bought an Eight-Six!

134
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,913
I kept it a secret, but it came today!

135
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,485
It's relatively new.

136
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:36,486
You finally convinced your
dad to co-sign for you.

137
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,223
<i>Well...</i>

138
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,959
The guys at the shop were friendly,

139
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,461
and I think I got a great deal!

140
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,096
Yes!

141
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,598
It's in good shape.

142
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,599
You're lucky.

143
00:12:50,002 --> 00:12:53,002
I can't believe you actually bought it, ltsuki.

144
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,774
I had to, Takumi.

145
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,775
I have to catch up with you, you know'!

146
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,245
I'll train hard to be your
"Downhill Eight-Six" partner.

147
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,415
I see your mouth got bigger.

148
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,420
I couldn't sleep last night...

149
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,420
...'cause I was so excited!

150
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,925
I know that feeling.

151
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,926
I couldn't sleep the night before I got my S13.

152
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,863
I couldn't help it, 'cause it's my own car.

153
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,202
My car... I feel like I'm dreaming...

154
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,307
'70s tires with original hubcaps...

155
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,376
So cool!

156
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:33,978
Why don't you start it up, ltsuki'!

157
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,229
Sure thing!

158
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,494
It doesn't sound too sharp...

159
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,495
It must be because of the original muffler.

160
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,965
Don't worry, I'll get a new muffler.

161
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:00,208
I want it to sound as cool as Takumi': Trueno.

162
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,043
I have a bad feeling about this.

163
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:07,534
Pop the hood, ltsuki.

164
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,696
--| knew it...
"Boss?

165
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,868
You got it all wrong, ltsuki.

166
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,870
What do you mean'!

167
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,639
--This isn't an Eight-Six.
"What?

168
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,374
It's an Eight-Five.

169
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,685
An Eight-Five... as in AE-85?

170
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,257
An Eight-Six and an Eight-Five
have the same body,

171
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,258
but their abilities are as far
apart as chalk is from cheese!

172
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,097
An Eight-Six has a DOHC engine,

173
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:02,098
while an Eight-Five has an SOHC.

174
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:05,334
DOHC and SOHC are
completely different, you know'!

175
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,873
Didn't you check the engine
before you bought it'!

176
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,874
Stupid!

177
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,447
Sorry, ltsuki, but it's funny...

178
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,018
My stomach hurts!

179
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,425
Itsuki, wait!

180
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,534
You went too far.

181
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:38,403
Put yourselves in his position.

182
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,404
We're sorry.

183
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,242
Itsuki!

184
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,782
Just leave me alone, okay'!

185
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,833
I can't.

186
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:01,893
I wanted to surprise you guys...

187
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,894
...but I was an idiot for buying a car by myself.

188
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,664
I knew it was too cheap for an Eight-Six.

189
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,168
I'm so embarrassed for acting
like an idiot in front of you guys.

190
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,007
I know you're laughing at me inside, too.

191
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,578
You're wrong.

192
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,579
The fact of the matter is, I envy you.

193
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,684
You envy me'!

194
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,419
Don't lie!

195
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,421
It's not a lie.

196
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,257
You're still in high school,

197
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,060
and already have your own car.

198
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,863
--My own car...
--Yeah.

199
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:40,898
So what if it's an Eight-Five'!

200
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:43,899
It has an engine and four tires.

201
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:47,303
It may not have power,
but it'll go fast downhill.

202
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,446
You can still practice your skills.

203
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,485
Cars are fun...

204
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:03,486
--You've changed...
--Have I'!

205
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:07,223
You weren't into cars as much before.

206
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,193
Takumi, I feel like I can
be proud of my Eight-Five.

207
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,932
--| don't deserve an Eight-Six yet.
--You're right.

208
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,771
You don't have to agree!

209
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,608
I may go for a spin at Mount Akina tonight.

210
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,080
Wanna come, Takumi'!

211
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Sure... in your Eight-Five.

212
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,884
Takumi...

213
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,553
Yippee!

214
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,554
I'll come get you around 10:00 tonight.

215
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,210
--Sure.
--Don't fall asleep!

216
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,902
I didn't see the famous Eight-Six.

217
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,204
I wanna take a look at it.

218
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,335
I can't imagine an R32 losing to an Eight-Six.

219
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:18,017
"That's an Eight-Six.
--Is that him'!

220
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,666
Wow, that was fun! Akina Pass is the best!

221
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,271
It's slow going straight,

222
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,271
but it corners like the
real thing, right, Takumi'!

223
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,608
Sure.

224
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,017
What are you doing'!

225
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,018
If you look at my Levin from a distance...

226
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,454
...it does look handsome!

227
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,264
My Levin is so cool!

228
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,265
I'm glad I bought my Levin!

229
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,746
I'm happy for you, too.

230
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,808
--They're kids.
--It can't be them.

231
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,980
The famous racer who beat the R32

232
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,882
couldn't be a little kid!

233
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,884
No way!

234
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,885
How old are you kids'!
I hope you have a license.

235
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,223
Otherwise, I'll have to tell the police.

236
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,224
Yes, I do! I may look cute, but I'm 18.

237
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,328
<i>Who do they think they are?</i>

238
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,665
--Stop tormenting them.
--| don't like it.

239
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,670
A kid like him is driving an Eight-Six

240
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,772
and acting like a street racer.

241
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,374
You live around here'!

242
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,215
Do you happen to know the
famous Eight-Six of Mount Akina'!

243
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,616
Don't act dumb.We know you know him.

244
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,617
I, uh, I've heard of him...

245
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,123
...but he probably won't be here tonight.

246
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,124
Darn, we came all this way for nothing.

247
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,028
Let's get out of here.

248
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,564
I tell you what, kid.

249
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:02,565
If you wanna act like a racer,
at least try to look like one.

250
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,735
I mean, look at this
Eight-Six with its ugly wheels.

251
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,483
It's embarrassing!

252
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,712
Pitiful!

253
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,712
And change the muffler,
'cause it sounds pathetic.

254
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,950
Don't you know anything
at all about an Eight-Six'!

255
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,722
Well, actually...

256
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,722
...this is not an Eight-Six, it's an Eight-Five...

257
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,394
...so a new muffler won't make any difference.

258
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,830
I'm thinking of getting one, though...

259
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:34,831
An Eight-Five'!

260
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,171
No one carries new mufflers
for an Eight-Five anymore.

261
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,810
Nobody!

262
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,245
I'm crying!

263
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,246
I never thought anyone would be
driving an Eight-Five in this day and age!

264
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:53,696
It suits you well though, kid!

265
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,510
--Let's go.
--Thanks for the laugh, kid.

266
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:19,944
Don't let any scooters tailgate you!

267
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,949
That's it! They're gonna pay!

268
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,985
Itsuki, do you mind if I drive your car?!

269
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,389
But,Takumi!

270
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,610
Go to the passenger side. Hurry!

271
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:37,395
What are you gonna do, chase them'!

272
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,396
This is only an Eight-Five with
loose suspension and '70s tires.

273
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,501
It doesn't matter!

274
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,403
We don't have to do this, Takumi!

275
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,005
It doesn't have LSD, either!

276
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,876
Shut up and put on your seat belt!

277
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,179
It may get rough,

278
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,648
but just trust me, okay'!

279
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,649
I promise I won't crash your precious car.

280
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,220
Here we go!

281
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,627
Takumi! Ohh! Ohhh!
