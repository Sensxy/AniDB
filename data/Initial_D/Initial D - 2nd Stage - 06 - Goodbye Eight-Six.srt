00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,113
Hi, boss.

21
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,114
We're not sure, but it's possible.

22

He was acting weird all day today.

Didn't someone from our team go to Akagi'!

We can make some calls.

25
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,027
No. If he went there to battle
it out with the Evo Ill...

...it's too late.

Kyoichi is too careful to give up the lead.

40
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,867
Kyoichi took the lead.

<i>I get it.</i>

49
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,871
<i>Since he doesn't know this course,</i>

50
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,912
<i>he couldn't attack it at
full speed when leading.</i>

51
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,847
<i>But while trailing,</i>

52
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,948
<i>he can predict what': ahead
based on my movements.</i>

53
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,469
<i>With that piece of junk... Pm amazed.</i>

54
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,335
<i>Considering our acceleration gap,</i>

55
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,405
<i>he must be turning comers
much faster than I am.</i>

56
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,057
<i>Unbelievable. His control is miraculous.</i>

57
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:39,208
<i>Should I speed up now,
knowing it'll strain the tires?</i>

58
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:47,513
<i>Or should I wait until the next
straightaway to speed up?</i>

59
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,919
<i>Silly me! I already know the answer.</i>

60
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,391
<i>I won'! change the pace.</i>

61
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,392
<i>It would be the height of folly for me to do that.</i>

62
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:06,035
<i>Perhaps that': how Seiji lost.</i>

63
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,037
<i>A top-notch racer controls tire strain.</i>

64
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,140
<i>H! stick to the basics... to win this!</i>

65
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,885
The gap isn't widening.
It's actually shortening.

66
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,890
What'!

67
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,891
The Eight-Six is going faster
than he would in Akina.

68
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,196
That makes sense.

69
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,197
What do you mean, big brother?

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
The mid-section consists of a series
of mid-speed S-shaped corners.

71
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,039
In this section, they can only accelerate

72
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:53,209
for a fraction of a second
from one corner to the next.

73
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,381
Yeah.

74
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,550
The rest of the time is spent

75
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,551
struggling with the constant side G-force.

76
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,455
With the misfiring system, Kyoichi': Evo Ill

77
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,560
has unbeatable acceleration
coming out of corners.

78
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,166
So, the Eight-Six has to compensate

79
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,167
by entering corners at a higher speed.

80
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,304
Utilizing its lightweight body,
which is his only advantage,

81
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,074
he brakes at the last possible
moment before each corner

82
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:28,013
and uses the grip of all four tires

83
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,184
to achieve maximum cornering speed.

84
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,587
If the Eight-Six weren't like a part of his body

85
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:40,924
due to all his hours of practice,

86
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:44,594
he couldn't possibly achieve a
miraculous performance like this.

87
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,288
He hasn't given up yet, then.

88
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,271
He may be unable to grasp the
concept of giving up right now.

89
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,779
He is becoming one with the machine.

90
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,240
That's all.

91
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:32,077
<i>Even if! shorten the gap at a comer,</i>

92
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,268
<i>he easily widens it on the straightaways!</i>

93
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,606
<i>That': the power differential.</i>

"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

95
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:49,826
This is Fujiwara Tofu Shop.

96
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,697
Yuichi, it's only you.

97
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:55,768
No, Takumi': not back yet.

98
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,940
What's going on tonight?

99
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,941
Everyone seems to be looking for him.

100
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,111
What'! To Akagi'!

101
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,781
I see.

102
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,653
<i>I applaud you... for making it this far.</i>

103
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,553
<i>This is a real feat.</i>

104
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,744
Later.

105
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,678
<i>This is the moment.</i>

106
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,480
<i>The end of the S-tum section.</i>

107
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,481
<i>I can go full speed after the next comer.</i>

108
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,319
<i>My serious racing starts now.</i>

109
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:51,422
<i>WI! end fast.</i>

110
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,667
<i>His style has changed.</i>

111
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,536
<i>For the first time tonight,</i>

112
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,537
<i>I'll use this feint followed
by an aggressive drift</i>

113
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:11,143
<i>to declare my intention of winning this race!</i>

114
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,548
<i>It': not a long straightaway by any means,</i>

115
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,541
<i>but it': long enough to shake him off.</i>

116
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,257
<i>He': fast! I can'! keep up!</i>

117
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,920
<i>Maybe this is it.</i>

118
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,362
<i>Can I catch up?</i>

119
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,351
<i>Or not?</i>

120
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,459
In the racing world,

121
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,460
a blown engine means defeat.

122
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,765
But like I said earlier,

123
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,486
I didn't consider this a race.

124
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,571
Now you can accept the reality.

125
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,064
Your car is dead.

126
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,716
The engine is completely toasted.

127
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:10,906
Why don't you put your
Eight-Six to rest for good'!

128
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,092
No matter how fast you can turn corners,

129
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,428
the difference between a fast
car and a slow car is too big.

130
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:23,099
We'll race again when you have a machine

131
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,475
capable of competing with me.

132
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,062
Is something wrong'!

133
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,865
I did what I planned to do.

134
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,401
It was just for fun.

135
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,770
<i>For fun'!</i>

136
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,771
It seemed too close forjust fun.

137
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,074
Well, it wasn't even really fun.

138
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:09,614
The Eight-Six': engine blew up
before all the fun could start.

139
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,517
He blew his engine?! That idiot!

140
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,388
I think the Eight-Six lost.

141
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:18,890
Seriously?

142
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,593
The Red Suns are in shock.

143
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,595
He blew his engine.

144
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,597
The Evo Ill was too much for him.

145
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,599
Too much difference in power.

146
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,601
He was undefeated until now.

147
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,669
I'm shocked.

148
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,671
I knew he would win!

149
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:37,772
Challenging him with an Eight-Six
was suicide to begin with.

150
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,912
<i>It': what was expected, but...</i>

151
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,916
<i>...I don'! get it. Pm not satisfied.</i>

152
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:50,586
<i>Was I expecting something else...</i>

153
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,503
<i>...from that Eight-Six?</i>

154
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,365
We'll save our race until the weekend.

155
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:01,966
I'm looking forward to it.

156
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,967
Enjoy your confidence while it lasts.

157
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,839
Because I'll destroy you, Ryosuke Takahashi,

158
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,970
and we, the Emperors, will conquer Gunma!

159
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:37,035
<i>My precious...</i>

160
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,516
<i>My precious Eight-Six...</i>

161
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,420
What'!

162
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,831
Hey.

163
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,562
Dad!

164
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,554
<i>Dad, I...</i>

165
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,655
We'll talk later. First things first.

166
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,410
We'll tow the car.

167
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:17,704
What are you doing'!

168
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:22,073
Stop staring and get in.

169
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,744
Yeah.

170
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,989
How did you find out'!

171
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,226
About what happened, I mean.

172
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,431
I had a feeling.

173
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,982
--A feeling?
--Yeah.

174
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:58,874
--Hey, Dad'!
"What?

175
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,145
I've been saving up,

176
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,146
and have about two million yen now.

177
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,484
Maybe it's not enough,

178
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,485
but I'll use that money to repair the engine.

179
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:13,522
You've got more than that.

180
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,692
You're richer than you think.

181
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,902
You've been delivering tofu sincejunior high.

182
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,837
I have a savings account in your name.

183
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:29,088
I sometimes borrow from it, though.

184
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,712
Then use that money, too!

185
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,514
I can't.

186
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:39,183
Is it that expensive?

187
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:41,919
How much will it cost'!

188
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,155
It's not a monetary problem.

189
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,876
The engine can't be repaired.

190
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:51,861
The pin that connected the crankshaft
and the con-rod snapped,

191
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:55,498
and the loose con-rod punched
a huge hole in the block

192
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:59,168
from the inside.

193
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,172
<i>It': my fault.</i>

194
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,173
<i>If! hadn't acted so irrationally...</i>

195
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,345
That engine is finished.

196
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,366
We'll need to put in another one.

197
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,483
Another one'!

198
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,818
Yeah.

199
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,819
Are you bringing in an
engine from another car'!

200
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:22,453
Even if it could run again,
it would feel like a different car.

201
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,364
Isn't that engine special?

202
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:29,365
You put so much effort into building it,

203
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:31,903
so let's try to fix it.

204
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,839
We'll borrow money if we have to.

205
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
I'll donate all the money I make!

206
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,178
We aren't that poor.

207
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,179
Then why use another car's engine?

208
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,428
If I could...

209
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,355
If I could, I would fix it,

210
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,991
but it's beyond repair.

211
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,992
That engine is useless.

212
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,126
That's that.
