<i>I feel like I've lost something important,</i>

22
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,090
<i>like a family member.</i>

23
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,263
Hey!

24
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,264
You look perfectly half-asleep, as usual.

25
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,334
It's too early to be acting so hyper, ltsuki.

26
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,873
Why are you so excited?

27
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,207
Why else?!

28
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:26,748
Today is the day the Red Suns
and the Emperors square off!

29
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,115
I'm already so nervous that I can't even go pee.

30
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,587
We should carpool like we did

31
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,257
when we went to Myogi.

32
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:42,238
I'm wondering if we can take your Eight-Six.

33
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,634
Maybe you didn't hear me.

34
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,635
I said I was wondering if we
could take your Eight-Six...

35
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,717
Hey, wait up,Takumi!

36
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:01,978
Anyway, I'm so excited about tonight's race!

37
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,817
Any predictions?

38
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,818
I predict that Ryosuke
Takahashi is going to win.

39
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,822
I don't think the Emperors' Sudo is that good.

40
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,828
He just drives a better car.

41
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:20,489
Stop talking about things
you don't understand.

42
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:25,938
Why are you mad'!

43
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,840
It's not that I'm mad.

44
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,841
Something came up,

45
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,624
so I can't go to Akagi with you tonight.

46
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,548
Why not?!

47
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,649
I just can't, so go with lketani and Kenji.

48
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,859
--What?! Ta ku mi lost?
--Yes.

49
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,097
He really did go to Akagi last night.

50
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:58,101
Rumor has it that his Eight-Six
stopped during the race.

51
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:01,406
Stopped?

52
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,407
Do you mean it's damaged,
or that he blew the engine?

53
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,078
We don't exactly know what really happened.

54
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,581
We're all panicking here.

55
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,851
We thought you might know
something about it, boss.

56
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,757
Takumi's dad is your friend.

57
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,426
Sorry, I don't know anything.

58
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,057
Hang on. I'll call him.

59
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,040
He isn't answering.

60
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,041
Takumi': probably at school, too.

61
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,431
It's very irritating that we don't know.

62
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,897
Hey! It's Keisuke Takahashi.

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,294
Is Takumi Fujiwara here'!

64
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,295
He's off today.

65
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,065
I see. I was hoping I could talk to him directly.

66
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,217
I have a message for him.

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,075
Last night's race doesn't count.

68
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,177
I don't accept it.

69
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:15,178
It was too strange to be considered a race.

70
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:18,248
I don't know what others think of it,

71
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,294
but I don't agree that
Takumi Fujiwara was defeated.

72
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,924
One more thing.

73
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,925
We will avenge his Eight-Six.

74
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,862
We will be happy to break the
conceited Emperor's nose for him.

75
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,334
Later.

76
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,773
We'll give him the message.

77
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,576
Good luck with tonight's battle.

78
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,447
We'll be rooting for you.

80
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:46,414
What?!

81
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,909
Not good!

82
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,610
Hey!

83
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,514
Itsuki... don't you think
this rock is a little too big'!

84
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,654
You could've broken the window.

85
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,655
I looked for smaller ones,
but I couldn't find any.

86
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,859
I figured it would be okay if I threw it lightly.

87
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,330
It's not okay!

88
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,941
You would've broken the glass for sure.

89
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,539
Oh, sorry!

90
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,540
I didn't do it on purpose!

91
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:26,323
I guess I deserved it...

92
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,247
I told you that I wasn't going to Akagi.

93
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,911
I know. I decided not to go, either.

94
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,089
Instead, I was going to Akina Pass for a drive.

95
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,160
Wanna come along?

96
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,177
Hey,Takumi'!

97
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,613
I'm sorry about this morning.

98
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,244
I didn't know.

99
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,953
I don't care about that,

100
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,954
but you heard about last night already?

101
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,290
I heard it from lketani after school.

102
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,997
They know, too, then.

103
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,998
Yeah, I hear everyone in
town is talking about it.

104
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,012
Everyone notices you.

105
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,395
By the way, lketani told me
to give you this message.

106
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:46,916
Hey,this car is right on my tail.

107
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,028
He's probably going to see tonight's race.

108
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,700
I guess <i>so...</i>

109
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,869
...but he's making me nervous

110
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,672
because he's so close to me.

111
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,663
I'll speed up a little.

112
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,150
He's trying to pass us.

113
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,818
You should let him.

114
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:16,159
What's he driving?

115
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,200
What?!

116
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,635
An Eight-Six Levin!

117
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,970
With turbo!

118
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,971
I heard the waste gate pass the exhaust gas!

119
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,141
He passed my SR-20 turbo like it was parked!

120
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,912
Unbelievable!This is uphill, too!

121
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,749
<i>Where did he come from?</i>

122
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,470
<i>Have I seen that Eight-Six around here?</i>

123
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,259
Keisuke Takahashi came to
the gas station and told them

124
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,762
that he doesn't think you lost last night's race.

125
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:04,169
I don't know what he means by that.

126
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,170
I did lose, because I was
completely outmatched.

127
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,374
The Emperors' Sudo was really that good'!

128
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,578
He was. I would've lost to him even in Akina.

129
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,884
I see.

130
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,885
So how is the Eight-Six'!

131
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,856
You can fix it, right'!

132
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,857
My dad thinks it needs a new engine.

133
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:31,527
"What?
--| shouldn't have gone to Akagi.

134
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,945
I'm regretting it big time.

135
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,151
The air is full of tension.

136
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,056
Did you hear about last night'!

137
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,057
Yeah. Akina': Eight-Six lost, right'!

138
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,260
I hear that Kyoichi Sudo':
technique is beyond belief.

139
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,831
I guess Ryosuke Takahashi
is Gunma': last hope.

140
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,959
I want him to win no matter what.

141
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,186
So, Shingo, you came to see the battle, too'!

142
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,956
Hey, Takeshi.

143
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,957
I figured I would root for the Red Suns tonight.

144
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:39,030
Ryosuke Takahashi won't lose.

145
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,031
We can't have the Ian-Evo
squad looking down on Gunma.

146
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,036
Yeah... Hey!

147
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,467
We're too close again. Let's keep our distance.

148
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,389
An Eight-Six!

149
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,290
--Akina's Eight-Six'!
--No way, it has a Saitama plate.

150
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:22,507
This is a good spot, Kazumi.

151
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,998
Yeah.

152
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,465
Here comes the Ian-Evo squad!

153
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,246
Good luck, Red Suns!

154
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,885
Do you have anything to say, Ryosuke'!

155
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,087
Not really.

156
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:12,088
Tonight's battle only involves you and me.

157
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,393
That's more like it.

158
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,584
Let's start a real race, shall we'!

159
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,344
Remember, you told me

160
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,247
that you wouldn't race in Akina anymore?

161
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,248
When I heard that,
I thought you were so brave.

162
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,519
Your wanting to race elsewhere impressed me.

163
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:47,225
Wrong!

164
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,226
It wasn't like that last night.

165
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,563
Something awful happened and I was furious.

166
00:13:55,901 --> 00:13:58,901
I was so mad that I didn't
know what I was doing.

167
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,742
That's why I ruined the car.

168
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,643
It was probably a punishment.

169
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,644
I shouldn't have been racing a
car when I was feeling like that.

170
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,684
I know that now.

171
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,685
I can accept the loss,
because I wasn't good enough.

172
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:19,088
But I can't stop regretting

173
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,726
destroying my dad's precious car.

174
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,277
Takumi...

175
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,340
What's the strategy, Kyoichi'!

176
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,208
Simulation X.

177
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,078
"X"? Do we have an "X"?

178
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,747
Ryosuke is an exception.

179
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,748
It's a special strategy for this battle.

180
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,531
I'll win with Simulation X.

181
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,291
I'm starting the countdown!

182
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,425
<i>Five...</i>

183
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,527
<i>Four... Three...</i>

184
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,796
<i>Two... One...</i>

185
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,197
Gog

186
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,177
<i>As long as my brother runs his normal race,</i>

187
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:15,518
<i>he won'! lose to that Ian-Evo.</i>

188
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,729
What sharp cornering by Ryosuke Takahashi!

189
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,945
How odd! Ryosuke usually lets
his opponent take the lead.

190
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,686
What will happen next'!

191
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,687
Awesome! Both cars are so intense!

192
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,858
This race is so thrilling.

193
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,859
Can you see their subtle strategies, Kazumi'!

194
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,196
What'!

195
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:08,197
The Evo Ill had a quick start,
but he didn't fully accelerate.

196
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,804
When they entered the first
corner all tangled up,

197
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,375
it seemed to me that the
Evo Ill retreated a little.

198
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,143
Perhaps the Evo Ill chose to stay behind

199
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,480
as part of some strategy.

200
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,985
It was worth coming to Akagi

201
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,236
to be able to see a race like this.

202
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,567
<i>I can win. I can win this race!</i>

203
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,938
<i>By staying behind,</i>

204
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:49,939
<i>I can see what Ryosuke is trying to do.</i>

205
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,610
<i>I've got him.</i>

206
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:56,241
<i>All the uncertainties in my head are gone now.</i>

207
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,669
<i>I haven'! forgotten it, Ryosuke.</i>

208
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,672
<i>What you told me a year ago...</i>

209
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,512
<i>...after I lost to you.</i>

210
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,887
Don't let this go to your head!

211
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,888
I still don't accept street racers.

212
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,671
They're all mediocre racers!

213
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:46,595
The motor sport technique developed
to achieve maximum speed

214
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:51,226
can't be inferior to primitive street technique!

215
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,058
That's what I believe.

216
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:58,843
You can believe what you want,

217
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,446
but the mountain pass
requires its own technique.

218
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,282
You won't succeed with just
the technique you learned

219
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,950
at Gymkhana and other circuits.

220
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,952
That can't possibly be right!

221
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:10,488
KYOichi!

222
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:13,489
I don't intend to continue this
fruitless conversation with you.

223
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,786
It won't lead to an answer.

224
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,231
If you believe your theory
is right, then defeat me.

225
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:26,582
If you can't, then it's just a theory.

226
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,913
<i>I won'! forget this.</i>

227
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:37,248
<i>H! defeat you,</i>

228
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,179
<i>and make you taste this same anguish.</i>

229
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,657
<i>I haven'! forgotten it, Ryosuke.</i>

230
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,494
<i>I know you know it, too.</i>

231
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,495
<i>All of our racing theories and personal beliefs</i>

232
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:56,042
<i>are riding on this race tonight.</i>

233
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,782
<i>Ryosuke...</i>

234
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,783
<i>You said the mountain pass
requires its own technique.</i>

235
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,888
<i>The boldness to take the shortest line...</i>

236
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,159
<i>wheel and toe...</i>

237
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,160
<i>...and the all-wheel drift
with zero countersteering.</i>

238
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,997
<i>You sure are fast.</i>

239
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,633
<i>But what': so special about your technique?</i>

240
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,794
<i>You're merely using circuit racing technique!</i>

241
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,409
<i>If you seek speed,</i>

242
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,410
<i>you'll end up having to rely
on motor sport technique!</i>

243
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,767
<i>My theory is right!</i>

244
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,090
Ryosuke': FC is moving smoothly.

245
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,110
The Evo Ill is right with him.

246
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,532
Here they come! Who's ahead'!

247
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,643
The FC or the Evo Ill'!

248
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,404
It's the FC!

249
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,834
<i>I'll show you how much I've
grown since last year, Ryosuke!</i>

250
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:41,583
<i>This is where my 4WD and
the misfiring system excel!</i>

251
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,395
What?! The Evo Ill passed
Ryosuke Takahashi': FC!

252
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,378
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

253
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,283
<i>There was always that
unchanging smile of yours</i>

254
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,554
<i>It was there on days when
I was too tired to go on</i>

255
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,226
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

256
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,035
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

257
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,850
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

258
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,719
<i>The warm wind</i>

259
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,859
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

260
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,534
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

261
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,542
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

262
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,782
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

263
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:48,390
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

264
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,380
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

265
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,516
<i>The Eight-Six is running again?!</i>

266
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,517
<i>The Eight-Six was seen in Akina!</i>

267
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:10,821
<i>Next on initial D: Second Stage...</i>

268
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,424
<i>"Dangerous Car."</i>

269
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:14,945
<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
