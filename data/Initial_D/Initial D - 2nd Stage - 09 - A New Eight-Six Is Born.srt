00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,347
Okay. That'll be 660 yen.

166
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,868
Careful, it's hot.

167
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,984
<i>Delicious!</i>

168
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,090
Oh, no! I'm ten yen short.

169
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,091
I'm sorry, but can I give you a 10,000 yen bill'!

170
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,962
That's too big.

171
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,123
--| don't have change for that.
"Really?

172
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,707
Oh, no...

173
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,826
Take it.

174
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,615
Thank you! I'll pay you back later.

175
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,784
That's okay. It's only ten yen.

176
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,785
I want to! I wouldn't feel good otherwise.

177
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,515
Where can I find you'!

178
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,059
I work at the gas station down the street.

179
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,563
I started a temp job at
the hotel where I'm staying.

180
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,368
My aunt works there.

181
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,539
I'm running an errand for her.

182
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,508
Sorry about the other day.

183
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,010
--You're nice.
--Well...

184
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,680
I was actually happy,

185
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,681
because people rarely
compliment my brother's old Levin.

186
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,687
It's your brother's'!

187
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,688
I don't know anyone in Gunma,

188
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,691
so I was feeling bored...

189
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,214
...and kind of lonely.

190
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,867
Let's be friends.

191
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,858
I'm Kazumi Akiyama.

192
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,240
Uh, I'm ltsuki Takeuchi.

193
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,931
See you soon, ltsuki.

194
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:09,387
This sensation...

195
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,138
Could it be...

196
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:14,021
<i>...that'!!</i>

197
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:23,001
Akina': Eight-Six is back in action?

198
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:26,002
Kenta thinks he saw it drive by.

199
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:29,962
He saw the "Fujiwara Tofu Shop" sign.

200
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,610
I wonder if he put in a new engine.

201
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:37,697
We should find out.

202
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,711
Yeah.

203
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,726
There!

204
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,747
<i>That engine sound...</i>

205
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,540
Big brother, wasn't that...'!

206
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,541
Yeah. He isn't used to it yet...

207
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,099
...but that car's been
revived as a scary monster.

208
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,060
It took you along time. Anything happen?

209
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,264
<i>No.</i>

210
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,099
After the deliveries,

211
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,668
I drove the pass a few times.

212
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,837
I used a lot of gas.

213
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,672
Sorry.

214
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,673
I don't mind.

215
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,179
"Dad?
--Yeah'!

216
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,180
Cornering with this car is tough.

217
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,185
What I could do before

218
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,454
isn't as easy with this car.

219
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:52,455
It's upsetting me.

220
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:55,938
I've been trying different things,
but it's not going very well.

221
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,398
<i>Good attitude.</i>

222
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,399
<i>He': trying to compensate with his technique</i>

223
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,535
<i>instead of changing the suspension settings.</i>

224
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,538
<i>Go ahead and struggle for a while.</i>

225
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,745
<i>Trial and error is an important process.</i>

226
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,714
<i>In time, this car will improve your
technique without your even knowing.</i>

227
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,853
<i>This car will be a tool for you</i>

228
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,106
<i>to move up to the next level.</i>

229
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,600
Oh, there you are!

230
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,441
Hey! Kazumi!

231
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,939
I'm here to pay you back.

232
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,709
Here.

233
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,612
Now we're even.

234
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,947
Yeah.

235
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,948
--You really saved me yesterday!
--Oh, yeah'!

236
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,752
Hey, who is that'!

237
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:56,503
See you at 7:30!

238
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,160
Who is that cutie, ltsuki'!

239
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,996
She's, uh, a friend.

240
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,965
A friend?!

241
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,966
You said we racers don't need girls!

242
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,035
What happened to "Lonely Driver ltsuki"?

243
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,759
Don't just laugh it off!

244
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,647
What'!

245
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,755
No way. It's a Levin!

246
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,525
Is this really your car'!

247
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,289
It sure is.

248
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,933
<i>Oh, me!</i>

249
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,934
I graduated from high school this spring,

250
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,772
so I'm a year older than you.

251
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:50,441
What did you do after you graduated?

252
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,442
I got a job, sort of.

253
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:56,280
But I didn't like it there.

254
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,281
My brother often tells me
that I'm a little impatient.

255
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,388
The one with the Eight-Six'!

256
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,324
Yeah.You may think it's odd,

257
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:09,325
but we were always together,
even when he went racing.

258
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,496
They say he's the fastest
downhill racer in Saitama.

259
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,201
Wataru': downhill is--

260
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:20,038
My big brother's name is Wataru.

261
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,229
They say Wataru': downhill is sharp.

262
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,478
He's starting to use me

263
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:30,479
<i>ES I“ EXCUSE KO COME KO Gunma.</i>

264
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:34,209
He may be racing at some pass right now.

265
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,425
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,426
It's our policy not to race in Akagi.

267
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,398
Is it because I drive an Eight-Six'!

268
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,399
No, it's because it's too easy.

269
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,669
Racers in Gunma know that the
Red Suns don't race on their own turf.

270
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,289
It's nothing personal.

271
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:03,714
I'll tell you one thing.

272
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,715
We take Eight-Six racers seriously.

273
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:10,719
Gunma's Eight-Six is a downhill specialist.

274
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,724
He has never lost a race.

275
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,159
What'!

276
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,462
Against any type of car.

277
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,797
An?' type of car?

278
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,732
Right.

279
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:24,733
Then you're qualified to
determine if I'm faster than he is.

280
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:29,407
"What?
--It's okay, Kenta.

281
00:18:29,408 --> 00:18:31,428
We don't race here.

282
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,646
I don't know who you are,

283
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,807
but come back in ten years if
you want to talk trash to Keisuke.

284
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,366
Fine,then.

285
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:09,017
<i>I hate to do this, but you've left me no choice.</i>

286
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:18,493
<i>If you're that desperate,
I'll play with you a little!</i>

287
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,393
<i>That': more like it.</i>

288
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,704
<i>Please teach that rude jerk a lesson!</i>

289
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,014
<i>That sound... it': a turbo!</i>

290
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,248
<i>He followed me out of the comer.</i>

291
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,249
<i>That car's power isn't ordinary.</i>

292
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,976
<i>Is it really an Eight-Six?</i>

293
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,897
<i>I don'! know how powerful it is,</i>

294
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:02,898
<i>but that much power will impede his control.</i>

295
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,269
<i>That cur is like a loose cannon,</i>

296
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,272
<i>but he': controlling it!</i>

297
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,511
<i>I just can'! keep up!</i>

298
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,262
<i>Darn!</i>

299
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:21,684
<i>I don'! know as much as my brother,</i>

300
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:25,187
<i>but this guy is very skilled.
I shouldn't mess around.</i>

301
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,782
<i>Get serious... or H! pass you!</i>

302
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:37,299
Man, this doesn't look good.

303
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,703
Luckily, we weren't going too fast.

304
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,406
Yeah.

305
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,209
I should put a warning reflector up.

306
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,878
I'd hate for another car to crash into us.

307
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,339
Yeah.

308
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,378
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

309
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,283
<i>There was always that
unchanging smile of yours</i>

310
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,554
<i>It was there on days when
I was too tired to go on</i>

311
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,226
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

312
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,035
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

313
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,850
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

314
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,719
<i>The warm wind</i>

315
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,859
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

316
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,534
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

317
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,542
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

318
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,782
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

319
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:48,390
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

320
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,380
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

321
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,182
<i>Hearing the rumors,
Wataru approaches Takumi!</i>

322
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,719
<i>What will happen?</i>

323
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,988
<i>Next on initial D: Second Stage...</i>

324
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:13,758
<i>"The Eight-Six Turbo!"</i>

325
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,309
<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
