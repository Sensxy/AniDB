with a bandage on his head and a neck brace.

93
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,038
He asked me to drive in his place.

94
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,039
Well, I can't say that I hate that kind of guy.

95

If you don't hate him,
then why don't you do it'!

Iketani is a good guy.

No, thanks.

98
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,583
I don't want to go sticking my
nose into these kiddie fights.

99
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,488
That's not my style.

100
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:59,489
So then it's all right if a kid
shows up at a kiddie fight, right'!

101
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,261
Are you talking about Takumi'!

102
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,596
That's right.

103
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,597
He's gotten pretty good, right'!

104
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,668
He still has a ways to go...

105
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,669
If it's Akina': downhill,
he wouldn't lose to anybody.

106
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,541
Well, except me, of course.

107

Your competitive spirit is showing.

108
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,745
I wonder where he got his
stubborn nature from...

109
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:25,081
But even if I order him to go race,
that won't make him want to.

110
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,085
Well, because of those
bandages on lketani': head,

111
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,106
I'll try to think of a good strategy.

112
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,876
A promise should never be broken.

113
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,044
There are only two kinds of people that I hate.

114
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:55,881
People who break their promises
and people who smoke.

115
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,882
I want to use the car this Sunday.

116
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,020
Sunday... you can't.

117
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,522
Why not?

118
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,091
I'll take care of the morning delivery.

119
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,860
That's not the problem.

120
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,860
I need to use it to go to
a town meeting on Sunday.

121
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,597
Really? This is bad...

122
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,770
I really need the car on Sunday.

123
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:22,772
It must be a girl.

124
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,443
None of your business.

125
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,878
Quit being so stubborn. Just let me use it.

126
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,214
It's just a crappy old car...

127
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:31,083
I'll take it if I want to.

128
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,552
A car won't move without a key.

129
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,221
I'll put it on a string and
wear it around my neck.

130
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,356
Not fair!

131
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,357
If you really want it that bad,
I'll think about it.

132
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,395
Really?

133
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,564
But there is a condition.

134
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,233
Condition?

135
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,233
Saturday night, go meet some brat
who's known as the fastest on Akagi

136
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,404
and beat the pants off him

137
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,406
on Mt. Akina': downhill.

138
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,075
What'!

139
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,744
If you do that, you can use
the car with no conditions,

140
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,745
and you'll get a full tank of gas.

141
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,149
Full tank of gas'!

142
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,421
<i>Full tank of gas...</i>

143
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:12,190
<i>This offer is truly irresistible.</i>

144
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,759
I'm out of money, too.

145
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,062
What're you going to do'!

146
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,403
Well, let me think a minute.

147
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:24,151
Fine, take all the time you need.

148
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,506
"Takahashi"

149
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,190
I'm coming in.

150
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,759
Keisuke, good timing.

151
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,228
I wanted to ask you something.

152
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,230
What is it, brother?

153
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,933
The Eight-Six that you saw on Akina...

154
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:57,068
Can you describe the speed of the car,

155
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:59,237
theoretically speaking?

156
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,840
Oh, gimme a break.

157
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,841
Unlike you, I'm not good at that kind of stuff.

158
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,845
Like I always say,

159
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,846
the most important part
of driving technique is here.

160
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:11,550
Whenever you battle somebody,

161
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,551
you can stay behind them and
learn whatever you want to know.

162
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,522
From your opponent's habits and weaknesses

163
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,925
to how well their suspension is set up.

164
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,926
Your ability to analyze is almost scary.

165
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,399
In my opinion, the fact that
you can drive without thinking

166
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,068
and still keep up with me

167
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,536
means that you're the one who's truly scary.

168
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,738
If you could apply theories to your skill,

169
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,874
you'd be the ideal driver.

170
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,875
I lost because I didn't know
the road and I was careless.

171
00:09:39,946 --> 00:09:42,847
I've never been disgraced like this before.

172
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,848
The inside of that Eight-Six must be a monster.

173
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,053
A monster, you say'!

174
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,054
This is getting more interesting...

175
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,528
Tomorrow is the meet.
Maybe I should go and watch.

176
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,972
Takumi!

177
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:09,973
Saturday has arrived!

178
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,242
What about it'!

179
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:15,580
What do you mean,
"What about it?" Today is the meet!

180
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,283
The meet with the Akagi Red Suns!

181
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,284
You promised that you'd borrow the
Eight-Six and we'd go watch, right'!

182
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:25,256
Sure. Speaking of which...

183
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,257
This is getting a bit complicated.

184
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,328
What did you say'!

185
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,329
You'd better not be trying to tell me
that you don't have the time...

186
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,734
No, that's not the reason...

187
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,271
If you back out at the last minute,

188
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,940
you can kiss our friendship goodbye.

189
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:44,941
Every day I've counted the days
on my fingers, waiting for today.

190
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,814
I know.

191
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,815
Excuse me!

192
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,817
Fried tofu, please.

193
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,186
Oh, it's you again.

194
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:57,322
You don't give up, do you...

195
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,591
Mr. Fujiwara, I beg you.

196
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,592
At today's meet...

197
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,798
I might do it...

198
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,767
I might do it, that's what I said.

199
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,605
On Akina tonight...

200
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,974
Honestly?!

201
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,643
<i>Ouch... My neck...</i>

202
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,046
Hey, are you okay?

203
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,314
Are you really going to come'!

204
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,117
I can't say for certain, but...

205
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:29,118
...I would say there's about a 50/50 chance.

206
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,222
What time does it start'!

207
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,658
The gathering begins at eight o'clock,

208
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,660
but the time attack begins at ten.

209
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,430
<i>Ten o'clock...</i>

210
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,431
If an Eight-Six hasn't shown up
by ten, you can give up on waiting.

211
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:45,503
You'll have to do it on your own.

212
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,672
I'll be waiting, Mr. Fujiwara.

213
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,341
I have faith that you'll definitely come.

214
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,342
It's not definite. I said it's 50%.

215
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:56,512
No, you've already decided to come.

216
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:59,617
Our team will be waiting for you!

217
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,219
Well, then, Mr. Fujiwara...

218
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,320
We'll be waiting for you on
the top ofAkina at 10 o'clock.

219
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:20,703
<i>I just can'! be cold to an eager guy like him.</i>

220
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,314
<i>If Takumi won't do it, then should I go?</i>

221
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,918
<i>No, no, I shouldn't. Pm getting excited.</i>

222
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,837
Did something fun happen?

223
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,242
You seem different today.

224
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,943
Really?

225
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,513
Aren't I always like this'!

226
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,514
You look happy about something.

227
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,784
Actually, I'm going to the ocean
with my friend tomorrow.

228
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,788
I'm really excited about it!

229
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,290
Friend? You mean a boy'!

230
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,291
What'! Of course not! I'm going with a girl!

231
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,364
I see.Well, let's go to the department store,

232
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,365
and I'll buy you a new bathing suit.

233
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,969
It's okay. I already bought one on my own.

234
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,105
I don't need two of them.

235
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:30,106
I'd like to see you in your bathing suit.

236
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,076
That's funny!

237
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,045
You've already seen everything.

238
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,046
You're such a perv, Papa!

239
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,050
I wonder if tomorrow will be sunny.

240
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,553
Don't ask me such a stupid thing.

241
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,554
The weather is great all over Japan.

242
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,158
Are you going somewhere?

243
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,660
I'm going to the ocean.

244
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,062
Ocean?

245
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,729
What?!

246
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,730
I'm jealous! I want to go to the ocean, too!

247
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,069
<i>Could it be...'!</i>

248
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:00,069
You're going with a girl?! A girl?!

249
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,673
<i>Sort of...</i>

250
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,175
Who is it'! Do I know her'!

251
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,176
Is she cute'! Does she have big ones'!

252
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,279
She's very cute.

253
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,783
Natsuki... Mogi...'!

254
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:15,354
Yeah.

255
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,089
It's cruel of you not to tell me.

256
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,090
Sorry, but the situation didn't
give me a chance to invite you.

257
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,029
Next time, okay'!

258
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,030
Please don't cry.

259
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,702
What's going to happen at today's battle'!

260
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,705
I heard that the Red Suns have
won every battle they've been in.

261
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,644
The outcome is already obvious.

262
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,113
Akina will be totally defeated.

263
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:45,083
However, the fastest team in
Gunma is not the Red Suns...

264
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,719
It's us, the Myogi Night Kids.

265
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,555
Takeshi, it's about time.

266
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,555
Yeah, let's go.

267
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,062
<i>Born with only the purpose of running fast...</i>

268
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,063
<i>A pure thoroughbred... the R32.</i>

269
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,520
<i>It won'! lose to Akagi': dumb rotaries.</i>

270
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,245
<i>Amazing.</i>

271
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:16,245
<i>The mountain is lit up like a festival.</i>

272
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,017
<i>Rumors about this battle
between Iketani': team</i>

273
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:22,018
<i>and Akagi': fastest team</i>

274
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,724
<i>have spread all over the place.</i>

275
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,531
<i>Which side will win?</i>

276
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,531
<i>Takumi': Eight-Six is Buma': Eight-Six.</i>

277
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,436
<i>It can'! lose.</i>

278
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,217
<i>It': been a while since I've gotten this excited.</i>

279
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,551
Wow, so many people!

280
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:56,552
I've never seen such a huge crowd on Akina.

281
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,156
The Red Suns brought them all
here to show off their speed.

282
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:04,660
If we lose tonight, we'll be humiliated.

283
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:08,164
By the way, the Eight-Six that
you were telling us about...

284
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,035
Is it for real, lketani'!

285
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,603
Yes.

286
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,603
I don't have any faith in that Eight-Six.

287
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,875
I heard that Keisuke Takahashi': FD3S

288
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:20,244
is lightly tuned for mountain driving.

289
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,245
But even still, there is a rumor
that it's putting out over 350 HP.

290
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,384
The difference in power is too great.

291
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:29,385
Even on the downhill, there's
no way an Eight-Six can compete!

292
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,289
Iketani, are you sure you
didn't hit your head too hard'!

293
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,561
An Eight-Six is an Eight-Six,

294
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,397
but this is not a normal Eight-Six.

295
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,398
Keisuke Takahashi said it himself...

296
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,867
On the outside, it's a normal panda Trueno,

297
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:45,868
but inside, it's a monster machine.

298
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,873
Trust me.

299
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,873
I'm sure he will come.

300
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,381
If he doesn't come...'!

301
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,983
There is a huge crowd here.

302
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,984
I don't want them to say
the Speed Stars ran away.

303
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,989
If he doesn't come...

304
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,724
If he doesn't come...'!

305
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,725
Kenji, represent our team and drive like hell!

306
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,707
You must be joking.

307
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,105
A bunch of cars are coming.

308
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:22,245
You can hear the rotaries.

309
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,379
The Red Suns!

310
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,224
They're here! The Red Suns!

311
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,356
<i>They're fin ally here.</i>

312
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,110
Wow, the Takahashi Brothers are so popular.

313
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:02,111
I heard that their father owns
a big hospital in Takasaki.

314
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:06,017
You can't win against the rich...

315
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,652
Driving skill is determined

316
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,653
by how much you can spend
on gasoline and tires.

317
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:12,256
"Hill Top Seki Touge Transport" by how
much you can spend on gasoline and tires.

318
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,257
"Hill Top Seki Touge Transport"

319
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,932
What the hell is Takumi doing?!

320
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,601
The meet is starting!

321
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,704
Even though I really made sure...

322
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,005
That stupid Takumi...! Idiot! Jerk!

323
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:31,006
You're not my friend anymore!

324
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,578
That hurt!

325
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,579
I can't wait anymore!
I'll have to go on my scooter.

326
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,550
Let's begin the time attack at 10 o'clock,

327
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:40,885
according to schedule.

328
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,886
It should be easier since it's late
and there aren't many other cars.

329
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,226
We'll use radios at the start and finish points

330
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,895
in order to time the runs.

331
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,895
In order to allow the drivers to run
full-bore and as fast as they want,

332
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,766
officials will be placed at the blind corners,

333
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,735
and in the event of oncoming traffic,

334
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,438
we will use lights to signal the driver.

335
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,740
I see.

336
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,008
Seems like they've done this a lot.

337
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:07,009
Yeah.They probably do
time attacks everywhere.

338
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,314
Well, now that I've said that,

339
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,314
let's enjoy some free runs until 10 o'clock.

340
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,208
The galleries are packed.

341
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,869
The Eight-Six hasn't shown up.

342
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,371
I wonder why...

343
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,742
Do they intend to conceal their
secret weapon until the last moment?

344
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,714
What is it'! Starting to feel like going'!

345
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:46,450
Sure, but I don't really want to.

346
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:48,753
Why not'! You've got no
confidence that you'll win'!

347
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:51,244
Drive like you normally drive,
and you won't lose.

348
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,267
It's here!

349
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:04,927
Keisuke': FD3S!

350
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,948
Incredible! Such a fast entry speed!

351
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,069
Next is Ryosuke Takahashi!

352
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,625
Run! Look out!

353
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,106
That's Ryosuke Takahashi for you.

354
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,216
His skill is the real thing.

355
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:57,019
Amazing!They can get
so close without hitting?

356
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,189
That's their signature Parallel Drift!

357
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,459
Approaching the other car
is the toughest part.

358
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,229
During the drift,

359
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,898
if you lack the skill to freely
change your speed and line,

360
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,899
then you can't do it.

361
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,969
But this is just a performance.

362
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:16,872
Driving for time attack is different!

363
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,426
<i>You stiff haven't come, Ghost ofAkina.</i>

364
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,595
<i>My only opponent is you.</i>

365
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,730
<i>Show yourself, Eight-Six!</i>

366
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:39,897
<i>“Green Shopping Street“
Show yourself, Eight-Six!</i>

367
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:41,898
"Green Shopping Street"

368
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,446
Do I need a paper cup today'!

369
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:58,447
You don't need it.You're not
carrying any tofu in the back.

370
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:02,951
This isn't a regular delivery,
so play as hard as you can.

371
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:06,357
Full tank of gas, don't forget.

372
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,426
I know, I know.

373
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:10,061
Well, I'm going.

374
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,062
Okay.

375
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,497
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

376
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,566
<i>$0 HO one IHTQFVQHQS</i>

377
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,101
<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

378
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,169
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

379
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,971
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

380
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,173
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

381
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,642
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

382
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,077
<i>'Cuz Pm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

383
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,078
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

384
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,949
<i>You tried to escape,
but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

385
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,019
<i>Something is within your grasp
and something is forgotten</i>

386
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,023
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

387
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,961
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

388
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,035
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

389
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

390
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,415
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

391
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,416
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

392
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,555
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

393
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,094
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

394
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,096
<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

395
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,298
<i>Reverberations left behind,
disappear to the next town</i>

396
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,133
<i>The losers are left in the dust</i>

397
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:58,102
<i>Let': ignore the constraints of logic</i>

398
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,070
<i>'Cause theyWe a pain</i>

399
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,206
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

<i>Rage your dream,

<i>Don'! look back on your love or your past</i>

<i>Member of the Red Suns,</i>

407

<i>"Keisuke Taka"!
"Give me that!</i>

408
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,206
<i>Hurry up and show yourself, Ghost of Akina!</i>

409
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,741
<i>Maybe you got scared and ran away?</i>

410
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,110
<i>Well, do you think you'll win this time?</i>

411
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,379
<i>Shut up! Of course I will!</i>

412

<i>Whatever it takes, H! get my revenge!</i>

<i>It's a high tension battle
