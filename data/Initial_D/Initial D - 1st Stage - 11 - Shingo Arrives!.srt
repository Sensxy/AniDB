<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

28
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,461
I mean, look at this Eight-Six
with its ugly wheels.

29
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:40,835
It's embarrassing!

30
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,470
I'm crying!

31
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,471
I never thought anyone would be
driving an Eight-Five in this day and age!

32
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,734
It suits you well, though, kid!

33
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,881
Don't let any scooters tailgate you!

34
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,856
That's it! They're gonna pay!

35
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,059
Here we go!

36
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,899
Takumi! Ohh! Ohhh!

37
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,471
<i>P... Please...</i>

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,471
Take good care of my Eight-Five!

39
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,709
"Act 11: Shingo Arrives!"
Take good care of my Eight-Five!

40
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,340
"Act 11: Shingo Arrives!"

41
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,472
It's not worth it, Takumi!

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Ta... Takumi...

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,950
Slow down, Takumi!

44
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,927
You nailed it!

45
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,796
What the heck'!

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,982
Hey, that car's right on our tail!

47
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,084
It must be some Akina punk.

48
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,455
You picked the wrong cars to tailgate!

49
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,627
<i>I see...</i>

50
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,628
Wanna play with us'!

51
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,014
That's enough, Takumi!

52
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,065
Stop the car!

53
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,727
"Curve ahead"

54
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,232
I said stop!

55
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,313
TakumiH

56
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,387
Unbelievable...

57
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,228
Is this really my Eight-Five'!

58
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,064
He is not bad at all...

59
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,001
No way!

60
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,537
Isn't that the Eight-Five'!

61
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,373
The one we saw at the pass'!

62
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:11,153
There's no way an Eight-Five
could keep up with us!

63
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,585
You're right! It's that Eight-Five!

64
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,621
Those punks lied to us!

65
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,023
It must be...

66
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,526
...an Eight-Six!

67
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,527
<i>Here it is!</i>

68
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,367
<i>What?</i>

69
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,297
<i>It won'! accelerate down the hill at all...</i>

70
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:44,031
<i>And these wheels won'! grip the road at all...</i>

71
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,317
Darn, he is so fast!

72
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,658
<i>This is so slow.</i>

73
00:05:57,156 --> 00:06:00,726
<i>I guess it': time for that move.</i>

74
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,802
You won't pass me, no matter what!

75
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,688
What?!

76
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,460
What just happened?!

77
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,896
How did he pass me'!

78
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,732
That's not an Eight-Five.

79
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,768
That's an Eight-Six!

80
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,869
A well-tuned Eight-Six...

81
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,642
What a big roll!

82
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,881
<i>Was it...</i>

83
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,881
...an Eight-Five'!

84
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,329
He went right through us.

85
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,231
That Eight-Five was spooky!

86
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,232
<i>Was it...</i>

87
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,126
...a ghost?!

88
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,217
- Want a coffee?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:29,512
--Here.
--Thank you.

90
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,949
Iketani told me... that your
downhill skills were abnormal.

91
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:37,723
Abnormal?

92
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,525
I don't think <i>so...</i>

93
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,526
You just can't see it yourself.

94
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:48,013
I never imagined that a car could run like that.

95
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,236
You've changed my perception.
It was that shocking.

96
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,441
I'm sorry it was so scary for you.

97
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,946
No need for an apology, Takumi.

98
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,947
I've never been this happy before!

99
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,685
Huh?

100
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,686
I realized that it wasn't all
about the car's capabilities.

101
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,823
If you have skills, you can even
maneuver an Eight-Five like that.

102
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,730
I fell in love with my car!
I'll take good care of it.

103
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,979
I'll train hard, starting tomorrow.

104
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,741
I don't care if people laugh at me.

105
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,208
My Eight-Five is the best!

106
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,019
Hey, let's go for a drive with
a couple of girls next time!

107
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,690
--Sure...
--No blowing me off this time, okay'!

108
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,594
--| mean it,Takumi!
--| promise.

109
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:55,425
The ocean, the girls, the bikinis...here I come!

110
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:13,947
All right!!

111
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:19,558
M31513!

112
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,559
You came back to me... as handsome as ever.

113
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,665
I'm going to cry...

114
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,536
--Are you trying to run over me, ltsuki?
--All right!!

115
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,705
We'll start training today!

116
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,575
We'll practice drifting with lower-grade tires.

117
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,677
Count me in, too!

118
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:41,488
Check out this cool sticker!

119
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,850
What...'!!

120
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,385
It's all right, isn't it'!

121
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,355
Yeah, sure, not bad...

122
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,356
Now I'm officially a member
of Team Speed Stars!

123
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,460
--The sticker looks crooked.
--Ta ke it off...

124
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,530
I should practice before I forget Takumi':
downhill techniques from last night.

125
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,434
What?! He let you in his Eight-Six'!

126
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,905
He sure did...

127
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:09,708
...though it wasn't the Eight-Six.

128
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:12,709
What's with the meaningful laugh'!

129
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,712
"Confess, ltsuki!
--Should I tell you'!

130
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,881
--Wanna drink gasoline?
--Okay, I'll tell you!

131
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,620
Well, he drove my Eight-Five

132
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,791
at the Akina downhill last night.

133
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,793
It was beyond my imagination!

134
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,129
I've never seen anything like it!

135
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,130
Even way before a corner,
we were drifting sideways.

136
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,967
All I could see was the blur
of scenery in the windshield.

137
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:41,272
It was miraculous!

138
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,642
He drifted with your Eight-Five'!

139
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,977
It doesn't even have LSD!

140
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,080
It was so quick.

141
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,082
We passed twojerks back to back

142
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,417
at the downhill hairpin turns.

143
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,408
I've never felt so alive!

144
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,856
Do you believe him, boss'!

145
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,259
I knowTakumi is good, but with an Eight-Five'!

146
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,295
It's hard to believe that any driver

147
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,767
could do that in an Eight-Five.

148
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,802
I know it's hard to believe,

149
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:13,803
but I saw what I saw.

150
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:18,307
If ltsuki is telling the truth,

151
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,644
that means that Takumi': adaptability

152
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,148
is far beyond what I imagined.

153
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,086
Since they both have the same body,

154
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,555
maybe they have similar maneuverability?

155
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,990
I doubt that.

156
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,992
That Eight-Five is a joke,

157
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,993
compared to the Eight-Six Bunta has built

158
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,565
and modified over the years.

159
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:42,467
A joke?!

160
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:45,468
You mean,Takumi can
drive pretty much any car'!

161
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:48,971
Just as long as they have the FR layout,

162
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,775
he can bring out their full potential.

163
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,947
Not just anyone can drive an Eight-Six.

164
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,784
You have to have mastered
the basic skills to drive one.

165
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,922
Bunta used to say...

166
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,002
"An Eight-Six trains the driver."

167
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,887
That car... had a Night Kids sticker on it.

168
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,127
It had street racing written all over it.

169
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,128
You can totally tell modified cars from others

170
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,231
by looking at how they run.

171
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,069
Yeah.

172
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,069
Lately, those Night Kids come to Akina a lot.

173
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,976
What do they want'!

174
00:12:57,977 --> 00:13:00,977
Well, since their leader Nakazato lost,

175
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,582
I don't think anyone from their team

176
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,803
will come out for a rematch.

177
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,134
I almost feel bad for him.

178
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,135
Now that Takeshi has lost to that Eight-Six,

179
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,305
he can't act all invincible anymore.

180
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,308
May I help you?

181
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,478
--Two coffees.
--Sure.

182
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,479
I heard that the Eight-Six driver
in the Speed Stars is just a kid.

183
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,287
I don't know how good this kid <i>is...</i>

184
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,956
...but when I beat that Eight-Six,

185
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,659
I'll be better than Takeshi.

186
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,660
I'll be the fastest one in Night Kids.

187
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,397
I don't know, Shingo.

188
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,566
I know you're fast downhill,

189
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,601
but I've heard this kid is abnormal.

190
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:59,602
I know I can take him fair and square,

191
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,340
but I have a more interesting idea,

192
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,341
which will ensure my victory.

193
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,845
Wham?!

194
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,846
You'll see. I'll show him an
impressively dangerous downhill.

195
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:15,718
The world only needs one downhill specialist.

196
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,724
The Eight-Six is outdated.

197
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:22,725
I'll make sure to send it to a scrap yard.

198
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,564
<i>Wha...</i>

199
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,565
<i>Shingo Shah of Night Kids...</i>

200
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:32,822
...is the fastest downhill racer in Gunma.

201
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,393
Where is Ryosuke'!

202
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,394
My brother is locked in his room,

203
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,666
staring at his computer screen.

204
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,768
He sure likes doing that.

205
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,769
He's the only street racer in Gunma

206
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:10,129
who trains by staring at a computer screen.

207
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,415
I wonder what would happen if my brother

208
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,416
and the Eight-Six of Mount Akina raced?

209
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,369
There is no way Ryosuke would lose to him.

210
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,625
Ryosuke knows all about that Eight-Six now.

211
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,796
I'm sure he has all the data he needs

212
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:37,486
to create a simulation of
a winning race in his head.

213
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,941
No street racer knows more
about cars than my brother.

214
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,979
I can't imagine him losing,

215
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,980
considering his exceptional skills.

216
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,217
Well,then...

217
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,588
But that Eight-Six won't lose, either.

218
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,124
That high-speed drifting...

219
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:05,029
...and his delicate brake control.

220
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,999
He's exceptional, too.

221
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,601
As a fellow FR driver,

222
00:16:10,602 --> 00:16:13,602
I may have fallen for the
way that Eight-Six runs.

223
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:16,074
Keisuke...

224
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,676
if they race, one will lose.

225
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,212
I don't want my brother to lose,

226
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,213
but I don't want to see
that Eight-Six lose, either.

227
00:16:26,251 --> 00:16:28,251
Strange, isn't it'!

228
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,623
Oh, sorry!

229
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,692
--Did you get wet'!
--No.

230
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,195
--Hold on...
--Sure.

231
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:41,736
Why don't we go somewhere together again'!

232
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,970
We can go to the mountains,

233
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,971
or the highlands, or the ocean.

234
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,844
--We're on summer vacation!
--Yeah...

235
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:56,114
Let's make a lot of memories!

236
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:58,383
We should.

237
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:01,384
Takumi, I wouldn't mind going with you...

238
00:17:02,921 --> 00:17:04,921
...on an overnight trip.

239
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,499
When is your next day off'! This Sunday?

240
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,069
It depends, really...

241
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,839
Do you want to take me for a drive again then'!

242
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,631
--With that car'!
--Yeah.

243
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,950
No blowing me off this time, Takumi!

244
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,188
Do you mind if ltsukijoins us'!

245
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,460
The three of us'!

246
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,463
I was hoping...

247
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,463
...you could find someone for him.

248
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,434
<i>Yeah...</i>

249
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,435
He's a good guy, but he's shy.

250
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,039
I didn't know you were so thoughtful.

251
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,870
I just thought it would be good for him...

252
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,184
Thank you very much!

253
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,185
Sure, I'll ask around.

254
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,823
Thanks.

255
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,724
I'm sure I'll find someone perfect for ltsuki.

256
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:48,126
That was awesome!

257
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,361
Maybe I should try it, too.

258
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,362
I'm getting the hang of
moving the rear sideways.

259
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:57,099
It's all about the timing.

260
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,302
You pull the emergency brake to start the drift.

261
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,243
But, lketani...

262
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:07,243
I didn't see Takumi pull the emergency brake

263
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,181
even once the other night.

264
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,182
Takumi uses the foot pedal brake

265
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,153
to shift the weight.

266
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,154
Don't worry, you're along way from that!

267
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,092
<i>Yeah...</i>

268
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,092
We usually go into a
corner and then accelerate

269
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,030
to skid the rear tires right before coming out,

270
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,031
but that's an elementary
technique called Power Slide

271
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:32,436
and is not a true drift.

and it looks good, too.

276
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,516
I see.You've done some research.

277
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,520
I was bored while my S13 was in the shop,

278
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,626
so I read some books.

279
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,362

280

I'm so excited!

281
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:03,365
I think I'm ready for the next step.

282
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:06,104
Instead of a straight line,

283
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,306
I'll try it in a low-speed turn.

284

<i>Let': ignore the constraints of logic</i>

326
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,070
<i>'Cause theyWe a pain</i>

327
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,206
<i>A streaker runs naked across the street</i>

328
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,408
<i>Something they would know</i>

329
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:06,408
<i>Rage your dream,

<i>To spend more time with Takumi.</i>

335
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,539
<i>To go on dates more often,</i>

336
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,539
<i>and make a lot of memories as a couple.</i>

337
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,044
<i>We're on summer vacation,</i>

339
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,383
<i>And even when we are together,
