--Big brother...
--Just so you know...

58
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,888
...the pass we're about to race
on is very narrow and tricky.

59
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:22,661
I'll take the lead first.

60
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:24,997
Since this is your first time,

61
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:27,998
we should take some precautions.

62
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,369
We'll alternate positions

63
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,871
and keep going until one pulls away

64
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,873
or passes the other.

65
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:37,042
It's a sudden death race.

66
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:40,043
If we're equally skilled,
another element will be the factor.

67
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,415
Another element'!

68
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,217
Luck, stamina,

69
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:48,218
compatibility with the car... that sort of thing.

70
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,022
Let's go.

71
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,858
When we get there,
I'll turn on my hazard lights

72
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,609
and we'll start.

73
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,634
<i>Takumi!</i>

74
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,740
<i>Did Takumi know that
Kazumi would be here, too?</i>

75
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,425
ls Shomaru Pass really that dangerous?

76
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,029
It's an old road.

77
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,998
It's not that long,

78
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,999
but you go uphill first,
then downhill from the middle.

79
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,338
It's half uphill, then.

80
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,540
That's not all.

81
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,842
It's narrow and has poor visibility,

82
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,678
which has resulted in many accidents.

83
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,747
The guardrails are all rusted.

84
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,083
The road': uneven and slippery.

85
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,084
Wataru has had two accidents there.

86
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,921
He said it was a tough pass to race.

87
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,591
What?!

88
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:01,526
This is Takumi': first time!

89
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,167
It's too risky!

90
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,507
<i>His hazard lights! Here we go...</i>

91
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,138
<i>Ready? Don'! crash your precious car yet.</i>

92
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,799
<i>It': an uphill.</i>

93
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,173
What?!

94
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,665
I told you so.

95
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,501
It's a great engine.

96
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,203
You can even stay with me on this hill.

97
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,664
No need to take it easy, then!

98
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,139
--Good night!
--Bye! Take care.

99
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,222
<i>Pm sorry, Takumi.</i>

100
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,692
<i>Pm the one who': to blame.</i>

101
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,297
<i>I know that now,</i>

102
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,699
<i>but I don'! know what to do.</i>

103
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,210
<i>So for now, I'll try working
part-time like youffakumi.</i>

104
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,604
<i>Pm determined to change.</i>

105
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:39,024
<i>I drive an Eight-Six</i>

106
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,025
<i>because defeating an opponent
with this disadvantageous old car</i>

107
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,094
<i>is so satisfying.</i>

108
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,200
<i>But this time, it': different.</i>

109
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,201
<i>I absolutely can'! lose to another Eight-Six!</i>

110
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:55,238
<i>I've never felt this much
pressure in a race before!</i>

111
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,359
<i>I can see the aura that
radiates from your Trueno!</i>

112
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,987
Is this a good spot, Keisuke'!

113
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,348
The course is so narrow that
there's no other place to watch from.

114
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,818
<i>There!</i>

115
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,008
Here we go!

116
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:35,761
<i>That sudden boost of power is to die for!</i>

117
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,523
The obsolete "boom" turbo.

118
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,326
Hey, Keisuke'!

119
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,829
Aren't Fujiwara': Trueno and Akiyama': Levin

120
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,830
basically the same car except for
their front and tail lamp designs?

121
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,701
--Yeah.
--Why do they run differently, then'!

122
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,005
Well, that's because...

123
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,108
I should have my brother explain it to you.

124
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,444
I understand it in my head,
but I'm not good at explaining.

125
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,116
Like Kenta said, the Trueno
and the Levin are like twins.

126
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,320
But since their engines take
different tuning methods,

127
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,324
they've become two completely different cars.

128
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:26,001
The method without the turbocharger
is called mechanical tuning.

129
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,763
Fujiwara': Trueno is that.

130
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,338
His foot on the gas pedal
controls the rpm directly.

131
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,911
Its instant response is its strength.

132
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,912
Even after entering a corner
at nearly top speed,

133
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:47,305
he can make further adjustments to his attack.

134
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,222
Unlike with a turbo,

135
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,258
he can attack corners aggressively.

136
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,259
Cars like his excel at entering corners.

137
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,030
In contrast, Akiyama': Levin is a turbo.

138
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,667
It may be a step slower at corners,

139
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:08,167
but its acceleration on
straightaway: covers that.

140
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,742
Cars with turbos excel
at coming out of corners.

141
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,846
How about the Levin's fishtailing, then'!

142
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,516
The "boom" turbo tends to lag,

143
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,854
so once the boost pressure goes down,

144
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,357
it takes time to get it back up.

145
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,358
That's why he keeps his foot
on the gas when exiting corners

146
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:33,196
and controls it using counter-steer only.

147
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,265
He probably mastered
that fishtailing technique

148
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,569
to deal with the peculiarities of his car.

149
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,974
Got it, Kenta'!

150
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,644
Pass racing is very complex.

151
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,105
Yes, I get it now.

152
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,787
What's up with that?!

153
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,224
Are you sure this is the place'!

154
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,225
Yeah, I guess so.

155
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,142
What's that'!

156
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,059
Takumi!

157
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,799
Wow! That's a "boom" turbo.

158
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,800
That car almost looks out of control.

159
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:53,903
He's barely staying on this narrow road.

160
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,607
But when he's on, he's super fast.

161
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,612
He's a different kind of opponent

162
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,923
who breaks all the conventional rules.

163
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,687
<i>This is the second round.</i>

164
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,190
<i>From behind, H! be observing</i>

165
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,941
<i>your undefeated Gunma-grown talent.</i>

166
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,596
This corner is hard to get through!

167
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,673
Right now, all the elements
are against Fujiwara.

168
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,611
It's a tricky course where
he has no experience,

169
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,725
and the Levin's irregular
pace breaks his rhythm.

170
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,854
But more than anything,

171
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,689
he has been feeling uneasy

172
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,690
with his new and unfamiliar Eight-Six.

173
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,211
That's his biggest handicap.

174
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:57,129
<i>The bad condition of this road
is making my car shake!</i>

175
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,973
<i>The inner edge of the road is unusable!</i>

176
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,990
<i>If the tires catch it, they'll slip!</i>

177
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,481
<i>I can'! use the outer edge
coming out of comers, either.</i>

178
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,600
<i>There's less usable area on this
road than there appears to be.</i>

179
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,029
<i>Takumi...</i>

180
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,030
<i>The suspension settings change
based on the engine power.</i>

181
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:31,569
<i>After I installed the new engine,</i>

182
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,570
<i>you kept saying you couldn't corner like before,</i>

183
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,842
<i>which is logical.</i>

184
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,503
<i>The car was set up that way.</i>

185
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,849
<i>Only by revving up to a
high rpm will you be able</i>

186
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,769
<i>to comer at a higher speed.</i>

187
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:53,725
<i>Notice that, Takumi.</i>

188
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,006
<i>Unseal the car': capabilities.</i>

189
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,469
<i>What': this?</i>

190
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,930
<i>Did I imagine it?</i>

191
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,483
<i>The turbo is so fast that Pm kind of scared.</i>

192
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,321
This car is nothing like it was before.

193
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,524
It needs more detailed maintenance.

194
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,827
And I have to watch the
gauges while I'm racing.

195
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,531
It costs money and takes effort,

196
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,503
but I have no regrets.

197
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,504
I've gained the power I was craving.

198
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,574
See, Kazumi...

199
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:46,575
...it's no good if you stop growing.

200
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:50,346
If you keep running away
from things you're bad at,

201
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,351
you'll never be good at anything.

202
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,020
You just have to keep searching

203
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,451
and moving forward on your own two feet.

204
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,126
Big brother...

205
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,795
Kazumi'!

206
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,796
Oh, thank you.

207
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,716
It's warm.

208
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,136
"Listen, ltsuki.
--Yeah'!

209
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:17,406
I don't think I'll be going back to Gunma.

210
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,981
<i>So...</i>

211
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,982
...I guess this is probably good-bye for us.

212
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,516
What?!

213
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,827
My parents found out about
my leaving work the other day

214
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,030
and are angry with me.

215
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,335
But that's not the reason.

216
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,005
I was thinking in the car.

217
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,006
I realized that I need to choose my own path.

218
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,245
Because only if I choose my own path

219
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:58,286
can I say to myself that I was right in the end.

220
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:04,387
My old job, and this temp job at the hotel,

221
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,991
weren't really my idea.

222
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,992
I'll find a job myself this time.

223
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,519
And I also have a small goal.

224
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,634
A scan

225
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,635
I'll save up and get my
driver's license, like you.

226
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:24,423
That'll be my first step towards independence.

227
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:33,182
I was wrong to think that
moving to another place

228
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,919
would solve my problems.

229
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,888
I want to hold the steering wheel

230
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,889
instead of sitting in the passenger seat.

231
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,094
I want to be able to run on my own,

232
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,095
without anyone': help.

233
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,333
<i>Kazumi, I, uh...</i>

234
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,003
I won't go back to Gunma,

235
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,004
because I can't get my license there.

236
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,637
<i>Uh, I...</i>

237
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,571
Thank you for everything, ltsuki.

238
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,785
<i>I...</i>

239
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,276
<i>...have fallen in love with you, Kazumi.</i>

240
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,837
The second round!

241
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,905
He's getting used to it.

242
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:29,240
What'!

243
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,371
It's time for the new Eight-Six to wake up.

244
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,363
It did get easier to control.

245
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,951
<i>I was struggling with it just yesterday.</i>

246
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,699
<i>Is it because of this power?</i>

247
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,830
<i>I can control it.</i>

248
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,669
<i>All right.</i>

249
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,340
<i>I may just pull it off!</i>

250
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,442
<i>I was planning to just
observe him in this round,</i>

251
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,346
<i>but that won'! work.</i>

252
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:11,347
<i>He': adapting to this tricky
course at an amazing rate.</i>

253
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,118
<i>No other first-timer could race this fast here!</i>

254
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,322
<i>Pm impressed!</i>

255
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,658
<i>Racers like you do exist!</i>

256
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,659
<i>I can'! lose on my home turf!</i>

257
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:27,166
<i>This will be a tough race!</i>

258
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,465
Make sure to rev up to 11,000 rpm.

259
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:58,827
<i>Good pass racers are the coolest.</i>

260
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,832
<i>You're not bad.</i>

261
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,833
<i>Your sharp technique could convince anyone.</i>

262
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,040
<i>I can go for broke with my Levin!</i>

263
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:16,214
<i>I wanted excitement like this.</i>

264
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,585
<i>Pm the luckiest man alive!</i>

265
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,974
<i>At the end of the last round,
I was going full blast.</i>

266
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,745
<i>H! finish you in this round!</i>

267
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,714
<i>You're a great opponent.</i>

268
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,645
<i>You've set my spirit on fire!</i>

269
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,378
