<i>Let': move into the brand new world</i>

15
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,094
<i>Let': dive into the brand new trip</i>

16
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,095
<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

17
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,865
<i>We've just begun, now we go
full speed and funky beat</i>

<i>It's not as if there isn't

26
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,555
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,556
<i>That': our law!</i>

28
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,131
That punk!

29
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,400
Hey, you!

30
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,401
I know you're the one who
hit me from behind yesterday.

31
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,472
Are you kidding me'!

32
00:01:46,473 --> 00:01:49,074
--That was your fault.
"What?

33
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:52,075
Your car was going so slow
that I couldn't anticipate it.

34
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,912
I never thought you could
attack a corner that slowly.

35
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,516
I tried to brake, but... bump.

36
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,353
What did you say?!

37
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,354
Calm down, lketani!

38
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:07,724
If you insist, then we'll race under my rules.

39
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,561
If I lose, I'll be on the ground
begging for your forgiveness.

40
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:14,698
What do you mean, "your" rules'!

41
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,936
It's nothing.

42
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:19,936
We call it the "duct tape death match."

43
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,609
Duct tape death match'!

44
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,610
I hear the Speed Stars' Eight-Six
is a downhill specialist.

45
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,383
Tell this Eight-Six kid

46
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:34,384
that I'll be waiting here
next Saturday at 10 p.m.

47
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:37,335
I'll see you then.

48
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:56,072
I think that punkjust challenged you,Takumi.

49
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,279
He didn't recognize your face, though.

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,048
Go for it,Takumi!

51
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,249
Duct tape or whatever...

52
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,250
Beat that jerk badly and
make him beg for forgiveness!

53
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,022
It sounds too risky, ltsuki.

54
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,057
He can't steer in this race.

55
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:13,726
But, lketani...

56
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:16,395
Takumi beat the FD and the R32.

57
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,396
His little rule won't make any difference.

58
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,399
I'm sure he's been practicing a lot this way.

59
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:25,571
Takumi, it's too risky.

60
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:27,572
Don't take the bait.

61
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,877
I have no desire to, really...

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,710
Good for you. Just ignore him.

63
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:44,166
"Act 13: First Date"

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,375
What'! A duct tape death match'!

65
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,544
--Yeah.
"That's reckless.

66
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,946
<i>Is Takumi...'!</i>

67
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:09,946
As usual, he's calm and unexcited.

68
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,918
He's not into it at all.

69
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:18,390
I want him to do it!

70
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,059
It would be so refreshing to beat that jerk

71
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,362
and make him apologize!

72
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:27,493
He drives a Civic, the rival
of the Levin and the Trueno.

73
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,069
In my day, we raced in a variety
of ways under different rules,

74
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,575
but the duct tape death match was
one of the most dangerous ones.

75
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,413
Is it really that dangerous?

76
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,951
It doesn't sound like it.

77
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,952
Itsuki, get in your car and try it for yourself,

78
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,322
then you'll understand.

79
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,395
--Well...
--Okay.

80
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,231
Don't let go of your right hand,

81
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,899
and steer all the way to either side.

82
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
Sure.

83
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,106
This is as far as it goes!

84
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:11,107
Leave the wheel there and come out.

85
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:12,912
Okay.

86
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,913
See how much you steered.

87
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,382
Sure.

88
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,383
What?! This is it?!

89
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,521
I steered as far as I could.

90
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,723
See;

91
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,558
How can you turn corners like this'!

92
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,927
Let alone drive the pass...

93
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,697
Steering can only be used to initiate the turn.

94
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:34,698
You have to turn by sliding the rear tires.

95
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:37,903
--All the corners.
--What?!

96
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:40,904
But Takumi is a drift expert, so he can manage.

97
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,076
It's not that easy.

98
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,745
You can't counter,

99
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,745
which makes it harder to control the drift.

100
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,048
Oversteering means a spin,

101
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,452
but if you go "under" into
a turn, that'll be the end.

102
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,123
This rule definitely favors an FF driver.

103
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,927
--He drives an EG6, right'!
--Yes.

104
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,996
Its accelerator eliminates oversteering,

105
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,535
so he can attack corners at full speed.

106
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,837
Its side brake also eliminates "under."

107
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,838
But an FR such as the Eight-Six
needs to continuously drift

108
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,841
through a narrow area as if
walking on a tightrope...

109
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,330
It's better to avoid it.

110
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,685
<i>Darn...</i>

111
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,686
<i>Talk like this may trigger his interest.</i>

112
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:32,623
Uh, boss'!

113
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,601
--Isn't that Kenji'!
--Oh...

114
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:41,600
lketani...

115
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,601
I did a little research on
that punk from the other day.

116
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,139
<i>He's Shingo Shah of the Myogi Night Kids.</i>

117
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,877
<i>Shingo Shah of the Night Kids...</i>

118
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,146
He's their number two,

119
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,882
but he's confident enough to call himself

120
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:59,883
the fastest downhill racer of the Night Kids.

121
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:02,588
He'll stop at nothing to reach his goals,

122
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,323
so he isn't popular with his teammates,

123
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,324
especially their leader, Nakazato.

124
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,997
I see.That's why he's challenging Takumi.

125
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,998
So that he can take over the Night Kids.

126
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,201
He's been spreading a
rumor about this already.

127
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,439
A rumor'!

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,507
A rumor that the Speed Stars are scared

129
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:25,010
and avoiding Shingo': challenge.

130
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:27,846
And he mentions nothing about duct tape.

131
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,382
He's making us look bad.

132
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:33,383
What a jerk!

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
He's trying to drag Takumi
into the race no matter what.

134
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,791
Oh!

135
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,791
Takumi...

136
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,448
I have no interest in racing him at all, really.

137
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:49,401
That's good.

138
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,402
You don't have to accept all the
challenges that come your way.

139
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,423
"Forget about it.
--Yeah...

140
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,947
Whatever happened to
the race with the Eight-Six'!

141
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,152
I'm all ready to go.

142
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,521
It's up to him now.

143
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:12,190
Don't worry...

144
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,826
I'll drag him out, no matter what.

145
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,827
Looks like it'll be an interesting race.

146
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:19,898
Takeshi!

147
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,899
Shingo, I hear you're
planning something big...

148
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,672
Do what you want,

149
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:30,392
but don't do anything to insult
the name of the Night Kids.

150
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,046
What's so funny'!

151
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,047
Isn't it you who has insulted our name'!

152
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:41,586
What'!

153
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:44,587
I wonder who lost to that obsolete Eight-Six...

154
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,360
...with a powerful R32'!

155
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,029
Shingo...

156
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,029
A loser should be off sulking somewhere.

157
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,735
Still acting like a leader
and giving me a lecture...

158
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,371
You make me laugh.

159
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,372
I'll avenge you, Nakazato.

160
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,808
Be thankful.

161
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,916
<i>Shingo, someday you'll find out...</i>

162
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,663
<i>...how fierce that Eight-Six is.</i>

163
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,726
Well,Takeshi is on the skids.

164
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,831
He's pitiful, really.

165
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:30,292
Shingo, you're the new
leader of the Night Kids.

166
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,199
First, I have to send the Eight-Six
of Mount Akina to the scrap yard.

167
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,491
Hello! This is Takeuchi...

168
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,467
Is this Saori'!

169
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,902
Itsuki'!

170
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,903
Of course, I remember you.

171
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:11,427
Yeah. A drive to Akina Lake'!

172
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,379
Okay.

173
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,547
Really?!

174
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,548
I'll meet you at that bus stop at 1:00, then.

175
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,261
Yeah, bye!

176
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,457
Yeah! I just put an end to years of no girlfriend!

177
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,796
I'll make it count!

178

Hey, Dad...

180
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,656
What is it'!

181
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,657
Is a duct tape death match...'!

182
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,247
No, never mind.

183

You're good at driving cars.

186
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,230
Takumi, I wouldn't mind going with you...

187
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:45,603
...on an overnight trip.

188
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,764
<i>Pm very conscious of her lately...</i>

189
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,529

190
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,869
Where is ltsuki'!

191
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,605
He was just washing his car...

192
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,606
Where did he go'!

193
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:25,411
"Practice Guide"

195
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:28,380

Is this where you were hiding?

196
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,380
Is this where you were hiding?

197
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,751
Um, I, uh, was just resting...

198
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,421
It's rare to see you with a book.

199
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,592
That's just, uh...!

200
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,593
Let's see: "Love Manual:
How to Impress Your Date"!

201
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:47,132
That book is just...

202
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,133
The reason you're reading
this book is because...

203
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,505
...you have a date'!

204
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,506
Yes!

205
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,675
Is it with that Saori girl you mentioned before?

206
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:01,846
What about me?!

207
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,549
I picked it up at a bookstore yesterday

208
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,051
and have been studying it.

209
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,052
You seem to have very little
advice on things like this.

210
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,223
That hurts, though you're
probably right about that.

211
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,463
Things are easier nowadays.

212
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,464
In my day, we had to feel our way through...

213
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,967
Let me see: "You should
have her by the third date.

215
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,045
I got that covered, boss!

216
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:36,581
So, like I mentioned before,

217
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,150
I would like to take a day off.

218
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,151

00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,203

223
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,976
I'm so happy!

224

I don't need gas.

226
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,955
I came to get the answer to my invitation.

227
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:56,160
You did tell him, didn't you'!

228
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,161
Yeah. He said he had no interest in it.

229
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,101
That's a laugh.

230
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:06,102
I didn't know that the Eight-Six was a chicken.

231
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,372
He can't be scared of a
duct tape death match, can he'!

232
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:14,356
That's all right. I'll make him want to do it.

233

We street racers don't talk
about "turning" a corner.

236
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,075
We "attack" it.

237
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,311
Maybe I should get a license.

238
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:56,312
Why not'! I'll teach you how to drive.

239
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:59,956
I'll think about it.

00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,193

So, what happened?

274
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:05,361
It's nothing. It's not as bad as it looks, really.

275
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:09,231
They're keeping me here to
do some tests,just in case.

Weren't you with Saori'!

277
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:16,205
She only had a few scratches,
so she went home.

278
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,708
I steered my best to
protect the passenger side.

279
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,878
What happened to your Eight-Five'!

280
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:26,148
I spun it well, so only the
trunk area was damaged.

281
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,320
Okay, you're done.

I was going down the pass

284
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,766
when an EG6 started tailgating me.

<i>An EGG'! Was 'W. him'!</i>

286

Maybe. It was a red EG6.

287
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,776
He pushed me from behind at a corner...

288
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,945
That punk did it again!

289

Don't let him drag you into it.
This whole thing is ridiculous!

Don't do it, Takumi!

<i>Don'! look back on your love or your past</i>

326
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,450
<i>Go forward and you'll shine brightly</i>

327
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,970
<i>Rage your dream, you're living in the now</i>

328
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,632
<i>Wasn't it wrong to involve Itsuki</i>

329

<i>Next on initial D, "Evolving Drift!"</i>
