00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,321
<i>Get ready, yo! Now we blow up the horn</i>

3
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,764
<i>in the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,501
<i>Payback for a dream I've seen so many times</i>

5
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,171
<i>My body is frozen in a
memory that! can't shake</i>

6
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,841
<i>Slam on the accelerator and deceive myself</i>

7
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,612
<i>Broken in the night</i>

8
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,748
<i>My eyes become sharper</i>

9
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,952
<i>All from someone': whim</i>

10
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,089
<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

11
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,194
<i>Break into the night, it': the time</i>

12
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,195
<i>With scared eyes, Pm lost in the night</i>

13
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,865
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

14
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,502
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

15
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,139
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

16
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,943
<i>Love me so much,
enough that! could fall apart</i>

17
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,647
<i>if only I could throw everything away</i>

18
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,284
<i>And just love you</i>

19
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,824
<i>Then I know! could face the truth</i>

20
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,561
--Takumi, it's for you.
--Who's it from'!

21
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,498
Ryosuke Takahashi.

22
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,900
What?!

23
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,669
Ryosuke...

24
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,670
...Takahashi.

25
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:50,173
<i>Less power, but fast!</i>

26
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,210
<i>He clears the comers faster.</i>

27
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,569
<i>There': no way my brother will lose to him now!</i>

28
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,518
A battle'!

29
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,519
--Yeah.
--Is that like a fistfight?

30
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,722
No, a "battle" is a car race.

31
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:09,862
If you don't want to race,just ignore him.

32
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:12,498
It's not that I don't want to.

33
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,900
I may lose to him,

34
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,002
but I don't want to not race him.

35
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:20,003
You still don't thinkTakumi can win'!

36
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,073
No. I know he's exceptional,
but he's still in high school.

37
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,378
I wonder how long he'll even
be able to stay in the race.

38
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,383
<i>The only reason I thinkTakumi has a chance...</i>

39
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:38,221
<i>...is that he': Buma': son.</i>

40
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,465
<i>The son of that crazy Buma...</i>

41
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,131
Keisuke...

42
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,132
I've been thinking about this for along time,

43
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,571
but when I lose a street race...

44
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,374
--...I'll retire.
--What?!

45
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,375
By the way, there are only two racers

46
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:01,945
who I think could beat me one day.

47
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:05,248
One of them is you, Keisuke.

48
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,286
Me?

49
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,287
<i>And the other is...</i>

50
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:36,641
"Act 25:The Last Battle!"

51
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:54,333
Takumi!

52
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,269
Good luck, Takumi!

53
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:59,269
I believe in you! I know you can win!

54
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,306
And I hope you beat Ryosuke Takahashi

55
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:04,307
<i>and become the fastest
racing star 'm Gunmaffakumi'.!</i>

56
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:06,612
Takumi!

57
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,613
Okay, we got it, ltsuki! Now get off of him!

58
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,118
You're late.

59
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:15,121
It's already 10:00.

60
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,311
You're still so ignorant.

61
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,459
I've been waiting for you.

62
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,988
It's impressive that you've
learned so much technique

63
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,161
at such a young age.

64
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:59,162
L'vejust driven Akina Pass more
than others, so I'm used to it.

65
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:05,498
I don't have any special technique.

66
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,290
I think you are just overestimating me.

67
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,015
That's interesting.

68
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,016
I guess you don't really
understand your own potential.

69
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,688
What'!

70
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:29,356
You're so unique.

71
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,237
It'll be nice to sit down
and talk to you someday.

72
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,573
Big brother...

73
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,775
Let's get started.

74
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:46,776
This should be a fun evening.

75
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,048
All right! Move your cars!

76
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,048
Yes, sir!

77
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:00,090
Is it all right if we Red Suns run this race'!

78
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,261
Sure.

79
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,261
Get some guys from Speed
Stars to be officials, too.

80
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:08,667
--Got it.
--lketani, I'll be at the goal.

81
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,668
All right. Do a good job!

82
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,008
Keisuke, I'll be at the five hairpins.

83
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,243
Okay.

84
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,246
Of course Ryosuke will win, won't he'!

85
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,014
We're going to get our revenge, right'!

86
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,315
Of course we are.

87
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,316
No matter how fast that guy is,
there's no way my brother will lose.

88
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,639
You're right. Okay, I'm off!

89
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,682
Hello, Fujiwara Tofu-- Oh, it's you.

90
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,686
Hey, Bunta. I just got to Akina.

91
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,290
There's a huge crowd over here.
You'd be amazed if you saw it.

92
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,495
<i>Yeah, and“!</i>

93
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:12,064
So, what do you say'!

94
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,499
Do you thinkTakumi can win this'!

95
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
I hear that his opponent is
Gunma's fastest, a street racing king.

96
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,206
Who cares'!

97
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,841
If you don't have something
else to say, I'm hanging up.

98
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,976
Hey, Bunta!

99
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,312
Wait a minute, Bunta!

100
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,453
I told you not to hang up!

101
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,239
All right! How are the corners looking'!

102
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:00,389
Okay! The first corner is ready whenever.

103
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:06,719
Skate Center here.
This straight section looks good.

104
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,986
The 17th hairpin is ready anytime.

105
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,597
Five hairpins here.

106
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,177
No cars around here, and we're ready!

107
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,036
This is Number Six.

108
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,816
We've moved all the
spectators' cars. We're ready!

109
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,996
I'm so nervous!

110
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,631
My throat is completely dry,

111
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,333
and my heart is pounding out of control!

112
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,334
The air around this whole
pass is filled with tension.

113
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,643
I wonder ifTakumi is feeling all right'!

114
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,111
<i>Takumi...</i>

115
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:08,313
<i>You're racing against the best.</i>

116
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,283
<i>It doesn't matter if you lose. Just do your best!</i>

117
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,085
<i>Come on, Takumi!</i>

118
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:15,805
<i>I know you can win this!</i>

119
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,763
<i>There': no way my brother will lose.</i>

120
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,532
<i>But something always happens</i>

121
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,023
<i>in Akina Pass when that Eight-Six is racing.</i>

122
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,725
Excuse me.What's happening with the race'!

123
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,527
It hasn't started yet.

124
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,718
Oh, I see. Thank you.

125
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,803
This is the starting line.

126
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,739
How does it look at the finish line'!

127
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,810
Yeah... we're ready here anytime.

128
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,349
Okay! Let's get going!

129
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,350
Hold on a minute!

130
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,689
Let me do the countdown.

131
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,259
Just for this race. Okay'!

132
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,566
<i>I have to do the countdown for this race</i>

133
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,757
<i>between my big brother
and the Eight-Six myself.</i>

134
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,604
I'm starting the countdown!

135
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:25,751
<i>Five... Four...</i>

136
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,720
<i>Three... Two... One...</i>

137
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,721
Gog

138
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,110
Go,Takumi!

139
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,737
All right!Takumi's going right by him!

140
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,785
Takumi is ahead of him now!

141
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,095
Takumi! Keep going!

142
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,959
<i>That': my big brother': strategy.</i>

143
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:12,995
<i>He always lets them get ahead at first,
and then catches them later.</i>

144
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:19,733
<i>That's how he's been winning his races.
His "fastest racer" theory can't go wrong!</i>

145
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:06,512
They're both amazing!
Extremely close twin drifts!

146
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,587
Using that much drift isn't
Ryosuke Takahashi': style at all!

147
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:16,372
What a show, right from the beginning!

148
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,775
Even Ryosuke Takahashi
started using drift right away!

149
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:38,014
I bet he wants to beat Takumi
using Takumi's specialty,

150
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:41,417
just to show the willpower
of a street racing king!

151
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,021
Takumi is doing great, too!
This is going to be an amazing race.

152
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,958
Wow,Takumi!You've got to win! GoTakumi!

153
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,896
Right, lketani'!

154
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,647
Um... right...

155
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:01,873
<i>How impressive...</i>

156
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,594
<i>The Eight-Six has never driven like this before.</i>

157
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,956
<i>I knew it. He has improved!</i>

158
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,347
<i>He uses very little
counter-steering as he stabilizes</i>

159
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,348
<i>in the final moment of drift.
That hasn't changed.</i>

160
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,351
<i>Bu! he counter-steers less
right after a tum-in maneuver.</i>

161
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,824
<i>I don't understand.</i>

162
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:54,824
<i>It hasn't been that long since the last race,</i>

163
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,028
<i>and his weakness is already gone.</i>

164
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:01,244
<i>He is improving in every race.</i>

165
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,269
<i>I need to change the scenario a</i> bit...

166
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,374
<i>...but that': all.</i>

167
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,343
<i>The result will be the same.</i>

168
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,443
<i>My "fastest racer" theory is invincible!</i>

169
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,620
Hey, Ta keshi...

170
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:24,620
Let me just tell you that I didn't park
here just because your car was here.

171
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:28,572
Don't you make any mistake about that.

172
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,895
I was planning to park here
before I even arrived.

173
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:35,400
Why don't you go away'!

174
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,401
No way! I also knew that this was
the only spot to watch the race.

175
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,056
You're the one who should go away.

176
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,843
All the beginners usually want to
watch it from such obvious places...

177
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:52,183
...like the five hairpin curves.

178
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,585
Right.

179
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,321
The race isn't decided in a spot like that.

180
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,322
This is the only point where
they could go for the win.

181
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,027
So, that's what you think too, huh'!

182
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,662
Let me just say that you're impressive.

183
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:06,663
You, too.

184
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:11,567
So, this place is really deserted, huh'!

185
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,605
If someone sees us here,

186
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,235
they'll think we're friends.

187
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,151
Shoot! How annoying!

188
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,890
Here they come!

189
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,003
Whoa! They're both getting
so close to the guardrail!

190
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,587
Oh, my god! That was amazing!

191
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,392
Whoa! What am I waiting for?!

192
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,393
I've got to tell him.

193
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:15,399
How annoying...

194
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:20,336
--Hello, Fujiwara...
--Hey, Bunta! Are you listening?!

195
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,807
Heck, it's you again.

196
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,976
Listen hard!

197
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,779
They just passed in front of me.

198
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,780
They were both drifting very hard,

199
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,751
with Takumi': Eight-Six ahead

200
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,772
and the FC right behind him.

201
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,592
Takumi was ahead'!

202
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,127
That's not good...

203
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:46,128
Not good'! Why'!

204
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,700
Calm down a little, Yuichi.

205
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,701
It's more advantageous to chase
the other car than to run from it.

206
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:56,474
That's common sense.

207
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,475
That's true.

208
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:03,479
The rear driver can study the course
and rhythm of the other driver.

209
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,553
If he's skilled enough,
he can also copy the driving.

210
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:11,554
But maybe he can also just drive away.

211
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:16,294
The driver in front is
under tremendous pressure.

212
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,341
Having another car follow
you at the same speed

213
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,564
gradually pushes you into a mental corner.

214
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,350
The harder you try to get away,
and the longer you're followed,

215
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:44,603
the more threatening your opponent seems.

216
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,663
On top of that,Takumi is still
new to such racing tactics.

217
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,768
I'm sure he's really freaking out by now.

218
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,741
You think so?!

219
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,741
Anyway, I'll give you a call
later with the outcome.

220
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,211
All right.

221
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:13,048
That boy...Will he lose'!

222
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,620
Maybe not...

223
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,580
Here they come!

224
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,924
This is incredible!

225
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,699
This is the 24th corner.

226
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,700
The Eight-Six and
Ryosuke': FC just passed here.

227
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,936
We've checked the time, and it's just amazing!

228
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,374
If they hold this pace, they'll break
the Eight-Six': course record...

229
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,613
...by seven or eight seconds!

230
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:50,614
Anyway, that's my report.

231
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:55,017
<i>Seven to eight seconds faster
than when I raced against him?</i>

232
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,522
<i>Give me a break!</i>

233
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,523
<i>Is this what happens when my
big brother gets really serious?</i>

234
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,696
<i>This is starting to get scary.</i>

235
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,697
<i>This race is going to become legendary.</i>

236
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,702
It looks likeTakumi is still in the lead!

237
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:14,205
All right! He can win this thing, right, lketani'!

238
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:17,206
Yeah. But I wonder how
long he can keep this up'!

239
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:20,242
--What?!
--That's Ryosuke Takahashi he's racing against.

240
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:27,513
I'll be happy ifTakumi can
just finish this race safely.

241
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:55,751
<i>Pm going at full power,
and he's right on my tail!</i>

242
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,302
<i>No matter how fast I 90,! still can't get away!</i>

243
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,722
<i>It': no good... l might lose this race.</i>

244
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,528
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi...</i>

245
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,529
<i>I can't even compare to such a great racer!</i>

246
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:16,634
<i>I really don'! want to...</i>

247
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,245
<i>...but Pm going to lose!</i>

248
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,553
<i>There was a time when I
wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

249
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,392
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

250
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,233
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

251
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:01,349
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

252
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,648
<i>Bloom like a red rose,
I hold you ever so tightly</i>

253
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,188
<i>All I can say is that I believe
my feelings are true</i>

254
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,995
<i>Let': enjoy our happiness...</i>

255
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:28,407
<i>Into our shining future</i>

256
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,219
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

257
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,894
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

258
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,966
<i>Bloom like a red rose,
I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

259
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,
I will never let you go</i>

260
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,480
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

261
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:19,318
<i>wand miraculous flower</i>

262
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:27,932
<i>--You know...
--I don't want to lose.</i>

263
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,534
<i>"Fujiwara Tofu...
--This race...</i>

264
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,204
<i>--His sense for drift...
--I don't want to lose!</i>

265
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,573
<i>Ryosuke, l...!</i>

266
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,375
<i>--Takumi, go!
--You can't lose...</i>

267
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,110
<i>Just like that!</i>

268
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,444
<i>Keep going!</i>

269
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,445
<i>win,</i>

270
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:47,182
<i>Heading towards the conclusion
of this emotional race...</i>

271
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:50,752
<i>Next on initial D: "The New Downhill Legend!"</i>

272
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,858
<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
