each other for some time now</i>

<i>Let': look for explosive thrills, it': the time!</i>

18
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,706
They're coming into the first corner.

19
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:50,197
The Evo IV is following?!

20
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,761
<i>No matter how well you tum comers...</i>

21
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,222
<i>...you're just an Eight-Six.</i>

22
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:28,044
Anyone driving a junker like
an Eight-Six is beneath me!

23
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:31,782
I wouldn't race them even if they asked.

24
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,053
But the car...

25
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,054
I'd have to say the Eight-Six
is no longer good enough.

26
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,291
We will never lose.

27
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,611
<i>The king of mountain passes is the Len-Eve!</i>

28

"Act 3: Premonition of Defeat"

30
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,419
With the speed of the Evo IV,
Seiji should take the lead

31
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:12,357
before the first corner, despite his late start.

32
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,358
That wasn't even Seiji': full start, though.

33
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,497
He stayed behind on purpose?

34
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,999
L5 he o u .
n Simulation 2-,,

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Offensive-minded Seiji is being very careful.

36
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,003
No need for that against an Eight-Six.

37
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,006
"Simulation 1" should be enough to beat him.

38
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:32,344
<i>Not necessarily.</i>

39
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,345
<i>Seiji is a top-notch racer, but he': not clever.</i>

40
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,848
<i>So far, all his races were easy,
so he's getting careless.</i>

41
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:44,187
<i>"Simulation 3" is to tighten his loose mind.</i>

42
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,458
<i>Don'! fail me, Seiji.</i>

43
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,927
<i>Stumbling here before facing Ryosuke...</i>

44
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,478
<i>...is unacceptable.</i>

45
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,728
Maybe it's too much to ask.

46
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,729
Basically, the Evo IV is a WRC rally car.

47
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,666
It's light, and is equipped with turbo and 4WD.

48
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,336
On top of that, the driver
has first-class technique.

49
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,941
Takumi can't win.

50
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,942
Come on, lketani and Kenji!

51
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,846
Why are you always so
pessimistic about things?

52
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,618
<i>But, ltsuki...</i>

53
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,619
It's Takumi who is racing!

54
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,290
Unlike others,

55
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,631
Takumi always makes
something happen when he races.

56
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,585
<i>Damn, I don't like this.</i>

57
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:26,535
<i>This is irritating. Damn it!</i>

58
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,234
Hey, Papa'!

59
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,397
<i>I, uh...</i>

60
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,268
I don't think I should see you anymore.

61
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,518
That's sudden. Can you tell me why'!

62
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:34,053
There's someone I like now.

63
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,102
I mean, I like you, too, Papa.

64
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:47,853
But this is a different kind of liking.

65
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,023
Sorry I'm so selfish.

66
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,733
<i>This is a joke.</i>

67
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,734
<i>Why does my Evo lV have to stay cooped up</i>

68
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,338
<i>behind this ancient Eight-Six?</i>

69
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,141
<i>I can barely step on the gas.</i>

70
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:25,510
<i>Pm getting frustrated.</i>

71
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,511
<i>"Full Blast" is all that': in my Evo lV dictionary.</i>

72
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,348
<i>Why use "Simulation 3" against this old junker?!</i>

73
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,906
<i>He': nowhere near that good, Kyoichi!</i>

74
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,513
<i>Don'! be impatient, Seiji.</i>

75
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,997
<i>What': this anger? Pm irritated!</i>

76
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,577
<i>Why am I so irritated?!</i>

77
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,908
Hey, Keisuke'!

78
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,909
What did Ryosuke say about this race'!

79
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,280
He didn't say much.

80
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,281
He only told me to be at this
spot if I wanted to watch.

81
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,454
It sounds like there's a reason behind that.

82
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,789
Yeah.

83
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,790
It's common sense that the
Eight-Six can't win this battle.

84
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,627
He's racing a Ian-Evo, after all.

85
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,831
Don't act like you know everything, Kenta.

86
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,834
Isn't it also common sense that your S14

87
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,121
shouldn't be slower than an Eight-Six'!

88
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,644
Don't torment him, Keisuke.

89
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,645
The race against the Eight-Six

90
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,649
turned out to be a great experience for Kenta.

91
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,140
Yeah, what do I care'!

92
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,257
"Emperor" or whatever they're called,

93
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,926
one thing will be certain after this battle

94
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,827
against Takumi Fujiwara on Akina's downhill.

95
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,001
<i>This is the longest straightaway on this course.</i>

96
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,331
<i>I can easily get ahead of him if I want.</i>

97
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,519
If you get impatient and jump ahead, it's over.

98
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,887
Damn it! I've had enough of this!

99
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,718
That's how everyone lost,
including my brother.

100
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,623
If you jump ahead, you lose'!

101
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,434
Right. Can you understand
that paradox, Kenta'!

102
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,878
Here I go!

103
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,328
<i>"Simulation 3" or not, Kyoichi...</i>

104
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,834
...I just have to win this race, right?!

105
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,316
<i>He': fast.</i>

106
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,317
<i>Now you'll see how outclassed you are.</i>

107
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,755
<i>Hljust keep blasting away</i>

108
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,258
<i>until you disappear from my rearview mirror.</i>

109
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,926
<i>See ya, Eight-Six!</i>

110
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,694
"Mt. Akina Forest Park Skate Center"
See ya, Eight-Six!

111
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,745
"Mt. Akina Forest Park Skate Center"

112
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,083
Would you please reconsider?

113
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:21,084
You really make my life worth living.

114
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,255
I really don't mind if you have a boyfriend,

115
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,428
as long as we stay the same.

116
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,429
I know, I can give you more gifts.

117
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,468
Papa, 51°!'-

118
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,639
It's not that.

119
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,976
I've always liked you, Papa.

120
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:50,215
Despite our age difference,

121
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:52,384
I thought it was normal to have

122
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,385
a relationship with the person I liked, but...

123
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,256
...now that I think about it,

124
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,992
that's why you were giving me gifts.

125
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,483
This can't be normal.

126
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,331
Do you really like this boy...

127
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,603
...that much'!

128
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,604
I probably do.

129
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,508
Right now, that's all I can say.

130
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,845
What'! Seiji got ahead of the Eight-Six?!

131
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,349
--He's pulling away!
--All right!

132
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,292
I knew it.

133
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:32,922
That's the Seiji we know. He's gone now!

134
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:35,794
--That Eight-Six is nothing!
--Yeah!

135
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:38,795
Despite his looks, Seiji is highly skilled.

136
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,054
He won't lose now.

137
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,680
Idiot!

138
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,608
<i>Seiji has mastered driving his Ian-Evo fast.</i>

139
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,947
<i>He knows that a 4WD car has to enter a comer</i>

140
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,667
<i>at top speed to be able to drift through it.</i>

141
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:14,597
<i>During the drift, you can only control the car</i>

142
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,501
<i>by steering while flooring the gas pedal.</i>

143
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:22,538
<i>The car tends to fishtail if you try to control it</i>

144
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,044
<i>with the pedal like you would an FR.</i>

145
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,045
<i>Full acceleration is the 4WD': way.</i>

146
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,783
<i>That': the hardest thing
about driving a 4WD car.</i>

147
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,288
<i>No mediocre racer can tum with full control.</i>

148
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,961
<i>But once you master the technique,</i>

149
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:49,671
<i>you can turn any corner
at remarkably high speed.</i>

150
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,765
<i>I guess I don'! have to worry about Seiji, but...</i>

151
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,508
<i>...why am I feeling so anxious?</i>

152
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:16,826
<i>Enter with speed and tum with full acceleration.</i>

153
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:20,163
<i>It': completely different from
the junker FR': slow "crab" tum.</i>

154
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,202
<i>Watch me and learn.</i>

155
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,203
<i>Of course, he has to be close by to see it.</i>

156
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,441
<i>I doubt he': anywhere near me.</i>

157
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:31,872
<i>He': so far...</i>

158
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,129
<i>What?!</i>

159
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,852
<i>He': right behind me instead of far back!</i>

160
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,355
<i>That': impossible!</i>

161
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,125
<i>He can keep up with my drift?</i>

162
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,606
<i>He': better than I thought. I see.</i>

163
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,662
<i>I get it now.</i>

164
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,931
<i>My irritation didn't come</i>

165
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,932
<i>from not being able to
speed up on the straightaways.</i>

166
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,769
<i>I guess I was aware of the actual reason</i>

167
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,393
<i>while I was following him.</i>

168
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,845
<i>I</i> hate <i>to admit</i> it, but I... I...

169
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,228
<i>Pm slower at comers!</i>

170
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,805
<i>So far, I've managed to keep up with him.</i>

171
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,870
<i>There': one more thing.</i>

172
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:08,473
<i>The straightaway: are shorter around here,</i>

173
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,474
<i>and the difference in power
doesn't matter much.</i>

174
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,378
<i>But just wait.</i>

175
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,713
<i>In the upcoming high-speed section,</i>

176
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:18,049
<i>H! erase you from my rearview mirror.</i>

177
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:21,390
<i>I bet my Ian-Evo racer': pride on it!</i>

178
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:37,066
<i>At the end of a long,
accelerating straightaway</i>

179
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,270
<i>waits a hairpin tum.</i>

180
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,321
<i>That': how it is.</i>

181
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,442
<i>Here it comes.</i>

182
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,245
<i>H! outrace you with my technique,</i>

183
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,386
<i>not my machine': capabilities.</i>

184
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,293
He's fast. He certainly is!

185
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,320
That's a very fast car.

186
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,658
They'll be here shortly.

187
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,152
Here they come!

188
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,722
The Ian-Evo is ahead. He's charging in!

189
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,593
Akina': famous five hairpin turns.

190
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,072
What power!

191
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,823
It's like a WRC car.

192
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,612
The Eight-Six is way behind.

193
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,115
I've never seen him this far behind

194
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,617
at the five hairpins in past races.

195
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,618
Maybe the Eight-Six can't pull it off this time.

196
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,390
That car is too inferior.

197
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,291
There!

198
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,542
<i>It': time to use the ditch!</i>

199
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:24,976
That was fast.

200
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,697
How did he turn so fast'!

201
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:32,718
See that, Masashi'! That's Bunta': son.

202
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,154
You're kidding me!

203
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,155
It sure looked like Bunta was driving it.

204
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,825
The sound alone shows how great he is.

205
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,830
He was flooring the pedal for along time.

206
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,831
No normal 18-year-old has skills like that.

207
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,437
Like father, like son.

208
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,338
<i>But...</i>

209
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:58,179
...that kind of driving
sure is rough on the engine.

210
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,366
<i>These are tough turns.</i>

211
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:22,164
<i>But! don't think! lost any time.</i>

212
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:24,168
<i>No matter the car...</i>

213
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,269
<i>many driver would lose speed on these turns.</i>

214
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,850
<i>I should be safe with this much of a lead.</i>

215
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,648
<i>What?!</i>

216
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,359
What happened? This can't be!

217
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:03,975
This is humiliating.

218
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,144
I can't shake him off,

219
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,212
even with my technique and power!

220
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,823
What is this?!

221
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,384
<i>Punk...</i>

222
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,255
Don't insult me!

223
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,964
It's almost time.

224
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:31,595
Iwonder who's ahead,
the Ian-Evo or the Eight-Six'!

225
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:36,207
Keisuke, you said earlier

226
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,278
that the Ian-Evo would lose if he was in front.

227
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,381
I know from my own experience

228
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,382
that he won't let you run away with the lead.

229
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:49,332
He sticks right with you like super glue.

230
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:54,392
If you get irritated and rely on the car's power

231
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,763
to shake him off, the tires deflate.

232
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,568
<i>Damn, he': right on me.</i>

233
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,569
The key is how you use the tires.

234
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,074
Anyone whojumps ahead
without knowing that...

235
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:11,655
...will lose.

236
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:19,782
<i>The from tires are losing pressure.</i>

237
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:23,085
<i>This is irritating. I just can'! stay focused.</i>

238
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,389
<i>Don'! panic. No need to shake him off.</i>

239
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,295
<i>H! win if! keep my lead.</i>

240
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,296
<i>Pm certainly in a more favorable position.</i>

241
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,900
<i>No matter how fast he can tum,
he can't pass me at a comer.</i>

242
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,471
<i>And Pm way faster on the straightaways!</i>

243
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,780
<i>I wasn't wrong.</i>

244
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,781
<i>Taking the lead back there was the right move.</i>

245
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,912
<i>Pm the winner, Kyoichi!</i>

246
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,378
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

247
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,283
<i>There was always that
unchanging smile of yours</i>

248
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,554
<i>It was there on days when
I was too tired to go on</i>

249
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,226
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

250
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,035
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

251
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,850
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

252
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,719
<i>The warm wind</i>

253
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,859
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

254
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,534
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

255
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,542
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

256
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,782
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

257
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:48,390
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

258
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,380
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

259
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,216
<i>The end is near. What did Takumi
decide during this tough race?</i>

260
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,921
<i>Next on initial D: Second Stage...</i>

261
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,690
<i>"Hollow Victory."</i>

262
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,061
<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
