Morning,Takumi!

21
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,669
What's with the sleepy face'!

22
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,138
I was born with it.

23
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,979
Hey, it's getting closer.

24
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:54,344
The race against Ryosuke Takahashi!

25
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,514
I'm so excited that I can't focus on classes.

26
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,087
We're talking about Ryosuke Takahashi,

27
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:05,088
the fastest and most popular racer in Gunma.

28
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,593
Do you have any special strategy, Takumi'!

29
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,564
<i>No.</i>

30
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,844
I'm not versatile enough to change
my race based on my opponents.

31
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:19,672
It makes no difference.

32
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,672
I just race the fastest way I know how.

33
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:26,245
If the opponent is faster, I'll lose.

34
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:28,780
Otherwise, I'll win.

35
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,116
That makes sense.

36
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,785
I'm counting on you, you know'!

37
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,786
What if you ended up beating him?!

38
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,554
That'd be so cool and awesome and...!

39
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,469
How embarrassing!

40
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,469
"Act 24: Akagi': White Comet!"

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,041
"Act 24: Akagi': White Comet!"
Welcome!

42
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,041
Welcome!

43
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,879
Oh, it's just you.

44
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,214
I got something very interesting.

45
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,215
You mean you got an adult movie, Kenji'!

46
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,053
Sorry, ltsuki.

47
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:09,622
This is better than that!

48
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,642
Better than that'!

49
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,800
They're racing.

50
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:23,469
It doesn't look like Akina.

51
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,469
Just watch the tape.

52
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,839
Can we watch that last part in slow motion?

53
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:38,982
It's Ryosuke Takahashi!

54
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:42,686
He looks so much younger!

55
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,691
This was three years ago.

56
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,526
How did you find this'!

57
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:49,526
Some diehard fan videotaped his races.

58
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,197
What a drift!

59
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:55,198
Angling into a corner like that is miraculous.

60
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,035
So cool!

61
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:02,939
Hey, I was actually there for that race!

62
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,445
I still remember it.

63
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:11,136
Back then, he was a lone wolf
and didn't belong to any team.

64
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,220
They called him "Akagi's White Comet."

65
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,221
Akagi': White Comet...

66
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:21,558
That sounds so cool that I'm shivering.

67
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,162
What about the Red Suns'!

68
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:27,163
Ryosuke personally handpicked
a few premium street racers

69
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,971
to form the Red Suns.

70
00:04:32,972 --> 00:04:35,972
That's why the quality of
his team is much higher

71
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:39,476
than that of our "friendly" team.

72
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:43,015
Now, he and his brother Keisuke

73
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,016
are known as "The Rotary Brothers."

74
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:49,185
But to me, he will always be
"Akagi's White Comet."

75
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,859
What are you guys watching?

76
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:57,029
MN' § <i>\</i> F $3 !

77
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,898
--Turn it off.
--It's okay.

78
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,899
Keep watching.

79
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,673
That's good stuff!

80
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,674
--Takumi's really racing him, huh'!
--Yes.

81
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:14,177
I bet it'll draw the biggest crowd ever.

82
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,750
Ryosuke Takahashi is a superstar,

83
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,751
and nowTakumi has become
famous as "Akina's Eight-Six."

84
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,891
That's right. A mysterious downhill specialist

85
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,727
has suddenly appeared in Akina this summer!

86
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,728
I'm so excited!

87
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:36,178
Honestly, who do you think will win'!

88
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,638
I hate to say this,

89
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,639
but I don't thinkTakumi
stands a chance against him.

90
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:45,977
This opponent is unreal.

91
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,980
I have to agree.

92
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,980
Ryosuke Takahashi is fast... ridiculously fast.

93
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,884
That fast, huh'!

94
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,121
He was already the fastest then,

95
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,291
but he's gotten even faster.

96
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:04,494
On top of all the street races,
he's repeatedly won the Gymkhana

97
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:08,131
and various circuit competitions.

98
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,134
He holds many course records
and has never lost a race.

99
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,638
His undefeated streak is unbroken.

100
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:20,881
And they say that he's never had
to give his all in any of his races.

101
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,316
He only uses half his ability
and still defeats any opponent.

102
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:33,223
So no one has ever really
seen his absolute best yet.

103
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,529
Well, ifTakumi can keep up
with him, it's a job well done.

104
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,300
<i>But...</i>

105
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,300
There you go with your negativity again.

106
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,171
Can't you be more optimistic?

107
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:51,207
Then who do you think will win, boss'!

108
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,667
<i>Well...</i>

109
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:58,314
Takumi has beaten Keisuke
and Night Kids' Nakazato!

110
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:03,653
And there was Usui': Sileighty
and the duct tape death match!

111
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:08,525
And a race in the rain!

112
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,363
I think...

113
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,363
I think he'll do just fine.

114
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,133
Ryosuke is by far the best racer
among the elite Red Suns.

115
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,571
Keisuke and Nakazato don't even come close.

116
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:26,409
To use a boxing analogy, the odds are 10 to 1.

117
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,981
IwantTakumi to win.

118
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,986
He's my best friend,

119
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,987
and I want our proud Eight-Six...

120
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:41,524
...to defeat the FC!

121
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,695
Stop crying-

122
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,439
Boys like cars, don't they'!

123
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:58,410
Sure.

124
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,679
Are cars that exciting?

125
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,281
Sure they are.

126
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:05,281
They can take you anywhere.

127
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,718
If you had to choose between
your girlfriend and your car,

128
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,190
which would you pick'!

129
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,192
I can't compare them.

130
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,182
My girlfriend is one thing
and my car is another.

131
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,632
Racing is very deep.

132
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:23,633
I've been thinking about
how to get better at it.

133
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,972
Thinking about that makes me feel good.

134
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,743
You're...

135
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,114
--...sexual.
--Huh'!!

136
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:38,083
Where did that come from?!

137
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,086
Why do you say that'!

138
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:42,387
Sorry, I just felt it.

139
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,723
It's women's intuition.

140
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,724
I'm pretty sure that I just got a peek...

141
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,596
...at your hidden sexuality!

142
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,597
What are you saying?
You're not making any sense.

143
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:59,908
Don't worry. You wouldn't understand.

144
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:04,774
When is the big race'!

145
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,580
Two nights from tonight.

146
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,415
Isn't it against a fast racer'!

147
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,750
Yeah.

148
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,621
I want to watch you race.

149
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:20,076
But maybe I shouldn't.

150
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,331
Don't crash.

151
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,332
You can lose, but don't get hurt.

152
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,980
You have to promise me that.

153
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:51,054
Ryosuke, you got another invite
from a professional team.

154
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,659
They called me today.

155
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,062
Again? Wow.

156
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,564
Which team'!

157
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,865
It's the "Hoshiya" Team.

158
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:03,866
They're looking for a young, premium racer.

159
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,538
They want you to call them
right away to set up an interview.

160
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:13,009
I know for sure that you'll make a great pro!

161
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,748
It's very exciting.

162
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,359
What are you gonna do'!

163
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,657
Turn it down for me.

164
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,195
Like I said before,
I have no desire to go pro.

165
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,834
What a waste!

166
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,835
Can't you at least talk to them'!

167
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,007
He's right, Ryosuke.

168
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,008
I'm not interested in the
professional racing world.

169
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:48,878
I'm only attracted to street racing,

170
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,181
where anyone can freely express himself.

171
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,885
The Gymkhana and circuit competitions

172
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,190
are the path I took to master street racing.

173
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,727
Right now, there's only one thing on my mind.

174
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,054
The Eight-Six on Saturday.

175
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,279
Done working?

176
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,482
Wanna go for a spin'!

177
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,450
--With you'!
--Yeah.

178
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,451
I've readjusted the car, sol
thought I'd go for an easy drive.

179
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:31,490
An easy drive?

180
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,292
I hate it when you talk like that.

181
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:34,660
"Akina Skate Center"
I hate it when you talk like that.

182
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,910
"Akina Skate Center"

183
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,668
--Hey, Bunta'!
--Yeah'!

184
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:46,669
Did you readjust the car for the big battle?

185
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,508
That's right.

186
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,528
I think I'll speed up a little,Yuichi.

187
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,449
Hold on!

188
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,525
I'm ready. Just a little bit, okay'!

189
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,043
<i>Here comes the comer!</i>

190
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,153
<i>What entry speed!</i>

191
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,814
<i>I feel the G-force diagonally behind me.</i>

192
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:47,499
What the heck are you doing?!

193
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I feel like having a smoke.

194
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,403
Stop that!

195
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,981
Keep your eyes on the road!

196
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,982
Oh, no!

197
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,654
Not too bad.

198
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,224
I'm serious this time!

199
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,423
Let me out!

200
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,447
The tires and engine are adjusted for the race.

201
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,188
How much horsepower does it have now'!

202
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:46,189
Well, I'd say its max is about 260 horsepower.

203
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:50,461
260 horsepower?!

204
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,864
You downgraded it!

205
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,366
It had at least 350 before.

206
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,402
It did.

207
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,904
Less horsepower?

208
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,905
Why did you have to make it slower?

209
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,710
You should remember that, at times,

210
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,711
you needless horsepower to run faster.

211
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,315
That's how deep street racing is.

212
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,785
The key to downhill success
isn't power... it's balance.

213
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:19,624
I thought I had adjusted my FC

214
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,625
to make it as fast as possible
both uphill and downhill.

215
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,496
I knew I could handle
even more power downhill,

216
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,833
so I upgraded the turbine
and raised the firing speed.

217
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,270
But in the end, I had to lose all that power.

218
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,476
Regardless of the reason,

219
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,579
this downgrade was humiliating to me.

220
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,579
I had to throw away my pride for this race.

221
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,582
The Eight-Six is that tough of an opponent?

222
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,454
I'm lucky that I've met
such an extraordinary racer.

223
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,358
My racer blood is boiling up.

224
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,095
Let's go.

225
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,614
<i>Less power, but fast!</i>

226
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,615
<i>He clears the comers faster.</i>

227
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,209
<i>There': no way my brother will lose to him now!</i>

228
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,492
<i>Right now, Pm not Ryosuke
Takahashi of the Red Suns.</i>

229
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,031
<i>Pm the lone wolf known as...</i>

230
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:36,032
<i>...Akagi's White Comet.</i>

231
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,749
<i>I'll win this battle, no matter what!</i>

232
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:51,216
Takumi!

233
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:52,750
Hey!

234
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,751
--Race day is finally here!
--Yeah.

235
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:59,357
It makes me angry, Takumi.

236
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,358
Everyone thinks Ryosuke Takahashi will win.

237
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,362
They say it's like a novice
fighting a heavyweight.

238
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,002
Aren't you offended'!

239
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,002
Any plan for a big upset?

240
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,072
<i>Let me see...</i>

241
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,776
<i>No.</i>

242
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:35,291
<i>Those racers are headed to the pass.</i>

243
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,130
<i>It': finally here.</i>

244
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,865
"Boss?
--Yeah'!

245
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,133
I've cleaned up outside.

246
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:43,468
I'll see you tomorrow.

247
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,970
Good job.

248
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,970
--You're going to the race, right'!
--Yes.

249
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,207
You still don't thinkTakumi can win'!

250
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,044
No. I know he's exceptional,
but he's still in high school.

251
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,985
He still has very little experience.

252
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,986
I wonder how long he'll even
be able to stay in the race.

253
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:08,126
<i>Not me.</i>

254
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,127
I actually think he has a chance.

255
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,947
--Why'!
"Because...

256
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,940
<i>.-H 6Y-
.-H 6Y-</i>

257
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,309
I better hurry. Good night.

258
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,310
Yeah.

259
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:37,953
<i>The only reason I thinkTakumi has a chance...</i>

260
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,458
<i>...is that he': Buma': son.</i>

261
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,782
<i>The son of that crazy Buma...</i>

262
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,040
The crowd is gigantic, as expected.

263
00:17:58,377 --> 00:18:01,377
If I were Takumi, I would want to run away.

264
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:05,343
I would be petrified in
front of all these people.

265
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,778
--Isn't that Usui': Sileighty'!
"Really?

266
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:26,170
I was right.

267
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,171
--They're both cute.
--Yeah.

268
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:32,477
How about around here'!

269
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,478
We may see some good tactics
at these complex corners.

270
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,482
<i>By the way, Make...</i>

271
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:40,703
...which one are you rooting for'!

272
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,490
Which one'!

273
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,492
The Eight-Six, right'!

274
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,493
Me, too.

275
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:53,397
He has a mysterious charisma

276
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:56,398
that only those who have
raced him can recognize.

277
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,869
You want to root for him
even though he beat you.

278
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,874
<i>Besides, he's...</i>

279
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,510
...so cute! Right'!

280
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,731
Come on, Sayuki.

281
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,785
It's almost 9:30.

282
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,686
This is it!

283
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,237
I'm so pumped "P!

284
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,790
Here come the Red Suns.

285
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,939
The Takahashi brothers are so cool!

286
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,847
--This is the enemy, eh'!
--Ryosuke!

287
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,427
Ryosuke Takahashi is finally here.

288
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,328
Now we wait for Takumi to show up.

289
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,351
The Eight-Six is not here yet.

290
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,920
I expected that.

291
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,520
He always shows up at the very last minute.

292
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,170
Keisuke...

293
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:42,171
I've been thinking about this for along time,

294
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:45,943
but when I lose a street race...

295
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,712
...I'll retire.

296
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,214
What?! What are you saying?

297
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,783
You'll never lose.

298
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,786
Just hear me out.

299
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,786
By "retire," I don't mean quitting racing.

300
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:00,658
I'll just step down from the number-one spot.

301
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,659
I'll still continue to contribute to the team.

302
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,630
What about our "fastest in Kanto" plan'!

303
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,400
It can't happen without you!

304
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,871
Don't make a face.

305
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,872
I have no intention of losing yet.

306
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,645
Remember this, though...

307
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:23,646
It is inevitable that someday
I will lose to someone.

308
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:29,151
By the way, there are only two racers

309
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,055
who I think could beat me one day.

310
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,326
One of them is you, Keisuke.

311
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,498
--Me'!
"That's right.

312
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,499
I see a racing genius within you.

313
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,369
You'll be even faster one day.

314
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,756
<i>And the other is...</i>

315
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,455
Takumi is here!

316
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:06,796
<i>'(ayffakumi!</i>

317
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,628
The other one is the Eight-Six, isn't it'!

318
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,067
I won't lose to anyone just yet.

319
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:21,576
Tonight, I'm ready for
my full-scale drift battle!

320
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,553
<i>Ai ni tsukare hate samayotteta koro</i>

321

<i>Yokubou duke ni kararete miushinatteita</i>
