<i>Information, it': an era

3
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,560
<i>Bu! you don'! know what
choice you should take</i>

4
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:30,129
<i>"Money can'! buy my love"?</i>

<i>You can'! even take a breath

10
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:47,077
<i>Never showing weakness but laughing</i>

11
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,081
<i>Safety is in lies, truth is empty</i>

12
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,152
<i>On the edge of danger,
I wanna shout and break out!</i>

13
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,923
<i>Now we gotta start let's get moved!</i>

14
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,825
<i>Let': move into the brand new world</i>

15
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,127
<i>Let': dive into the brand new trip</i>

16
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,128
<i>Frightened by the wide world</i>

17
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:08,832
<i>We've just begun, now we go
full speed and funky beat</i>

18
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:13,136
<i>We will shine around the world</i>

19
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,308
<i>Trip to the world
Yo! Here we go unknown world</i>

20
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,344
<i>We newborn travelers</i>

21
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,546
<i>The unfamiliar walk is still charming</i>

22
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,448
<i>The place you want to go is under your feet!</i>

23
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,783
<i>So many people in this world</i>

24
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:26,185
<i>It's not as if there isn't
backstabbing once in a while</i>

25
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,021
<i>Let': warp past these boring things</i>

26
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,522
<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

27
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,522
<i>That': our law!</i>

28
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,565
<i>Don'! feel bad.</i>

29
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,436
<i>The Eight-Six of Mount Akina
will simply tum into metaljunk.</i>

30
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:30,714
<i>Pm pissed off! He did that on purpose.</i>

31
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:35,534
<i>I refuse to lose to scum like you!</i>

32
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:45,788
"Act 15: Takumi': Fury!"

33
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,004
Wow, watch out!

34
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:40,152
Didn't hejust hit the guardrail on purpose?

35
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,153
And he used the rebound to reverse-drift!

36
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,676
What's that Eight-Six thinking?!

37
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,557
<i>Are you serious?
The Eight-Six is closing the gap!</i>

38
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,861
<i>That': impossible!</i>

39
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,539
Does he have a death wish'!

40
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,539
That Eight-Six driver has lost his cool.

41
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,843
<i>When an average racer
loses his cool, that': the and.</i>

42
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:43,513
<i>He keeps making mistakes, so he can'! go fast.</i>

43
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,085
<i>But this guy is different.</i>

44
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,086
<i>His innate driving sense takes over
and controls the Eight-Six.</i>

45
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,327
<i>The hotter he gets, the faster he goes.</i>

46
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,600
<i>This race is over, Shin go.</i>

47
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,577
<i>Darn...</i>

48
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:14,577
<i>My E66 has been running near its limit.</i>

49
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,515
<i>What the heck is going on?!</i>

50
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,195
<i>Pm scared.</i>

51
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:33,656
<i>I've never felt this scared
in a downhill race before.</i>

52
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,924
<i>He': on my tail!</i>

53
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,925
<i>I can'! believe my 5G6, the best of its class,</i>

54
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,997
<i>is being overtaken by an Eight-Six!</i>

55
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,832
<i>It': not about the speed anymore,</i>

56
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,001
<i>but something fundamentally different.</i>

57
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,236
<i>That Eight-Six is unreal.</i>

58
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,237
<i>Bu! all I have to do is make
sure he doesn't pass me.</i>

59
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:17,907
<i>After these hairpin turns, the finish is near.</i>

60
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,244
<i>H! win this race!</i>

61
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,852
<i>Don'! think H! give you the inside!</i>

62
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,239
<i>No! Is he gonna bump me back?</i>

63
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,665
<i>Oh, no!</i>

64
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,978
<i>I thought he was gonna bump me, but...</i>

65
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,347
<i>...that cornering!</i>

66
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,348
<i>He slipped right through on the inside.</i>

67
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,819
Yeah, Eight-Six!

68
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,900
<i>He passed me...</i>

69
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,691
That's incomprehensible!

70
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,345
I hope Takumi is okay.

71
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,307
Maybe we don't need to
worry about him anymore.

72
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,842
What'!

73
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,477
He's come this far,

74
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,146
which means that he has
adapted to the situation.

75
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,147
Who knows'! He may be
way ahead of that EG6.

76
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,718
If that's the case,

77
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,718
that Night Kids punk must
be sweating like a pig.

78
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,825
Yeah. Right about now,

79
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:44,076
he may be regretting
having challenged Takumi.

80
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,445
<i>This death match was my idea...</i>

81
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:05,448
<i>if I lose, H! be the laughingstock of the team.</i>

82
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,715
<i>I'll make sure to protect my pride,
even if it means a tie.</i>

83
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,559
<i>This is a short, straight line,</i>

84
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,228
<i>but the 8-16A engine can
get me side by side with him.</i>

85
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,097
<i>He can'! escape.</i>

86
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:21,032
<i>How about ending this race...</i>

87
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,173
<i>...with a double crash?!</i>

88
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:12,318
Here they come! Who is ahead'!

89
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,658
The EG6, of course.

90
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,590
The Eight-Six?!

91
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:31,937
What's wrong with him?!

92
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:34,338
Was he gonna kill me or what?!

93
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,551
<i>The EGG isn't coming.</i>

94
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,661
What happened to Shingo'!

95
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,203
<i>My see...</i>

96
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,044
--Is that Takumi?!
--No!

97
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,249
Did you crash'!

98
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:55,588
You're lucky it wasn't worse.

99
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,458
Are you okay'! Injured'!

100
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,028
<i>Get 'm.</i>

101
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:07,132
I'll give you a ride to the hospital.

102
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,683
It's faster than calling an ambulance.

103
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,272
I can't let you do that much.

104
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,979
Just make a phone call for me.

105
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,417
Don't act so tough.You're hurt.

106
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,919
When we crash, we help each other out.

107
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,920
We're locals, so we know
an emergency hospital.

108
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:35,223
Thanks. I owe you one.

109
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,065
He's unbelievable.

110
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,906
Who is he, anyway?

111
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,522
Takumi'! Takumi!

112
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,525
Are you awake'! Come down for a second.

113
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,630
What'!

114
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,630
I'm awake. I'm on time.

115
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,474
Just come down a minute.

116
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,843
How do you explain this mess'!

117
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,681
You bumped the car, didn't you'!

118
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,682
I see three scratches
made by hitting guardrails.

119
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,386
I don't remember...

120
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,956
Maybe it was you.

121
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,358
I didn't drive at all yesterday!

122
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,893
Only you drove it!

123
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:44,894
Look at these scratches on
the bumper and the fender!

124
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:49,232
You're right! Who did this, really?!

125
00:12:49,735 --> 00:12:51,236
Ips
y“!

126
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,017
Ouch! What was that for'!

127
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,243
--Oh...
"What?

128
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,244
I may remember bumping it a little.

129
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,716
What's wrong with you'!

130
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:07,717
You're still too young to forget things.

131
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,020
I raced against this jerk yesterday

132
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,224
and lost my cool during the race,

133
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:19,504
and came home all
flustered and just fell asleep.

134
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,102
I don't know how it happened,

135
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,038
but as long as you bump the car,
you're still a beginner.

136
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,139
I wouldn't have bumped it once.

137
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,179
And did you win'!

138
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,282
<i>Yeah...</i>

139
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,852
I see.

140
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,917
Are you allowed to do that, ltsuki'!

141
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,321
Yeah.The test results showed no problems.

142
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,657
I'll be out soon.

143
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,164
I brought you flowers.

144
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:27,164
I'll put them in here.

145
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
Thank you.

146
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,639
So, I heard,Takumi!

147
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,640
You won the duct tape death match!

148
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,676
Yeah.

149
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,514
Takumi, you're the best,

150
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,514
defeating him with that FR-killer rule!

151
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,153
You're nothing short of a genius!

152
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:49,754
<i>Hsuki...</i>

153
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,755
...I really wanted to win
that race, no matter what.

154
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,959
He pissed me off, but that's not why.

155
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,832
I just didn't want to lose the race.

156
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,833
I had never felt that way before during a race.

157
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,036
You're becoming more like a real street racer.

158
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,506
A street racer'! No, it's not like that.

159
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:13,676
I'll refine my skills when I get out of here

160
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,639
so that I won't embarrass you
and our Akina "Levin Trueno" team.

161
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,620
What were you talking about?

162
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,188
Um, nothing...

163
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,157
By the way, how is Saori'!

164
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,059
I'm worried about her.

165
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,862
She's fine. She says hi.

166
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,698
Cool!

167
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,698
When I get out of here, all four
of us can go for a drive again!

168
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:39,002
--Sure.
--Yeah.

169
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,475
I'm glad that ltsuki is okay.

170
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:47,476
Yeah. His Eight-Five should be back soon, too.

171
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,814
I lied about something.

172
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,518
Saori was shaken up so
badly after the accident

173
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,753
that she doesn't want to
think about it ever again.

174
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,596
<i>Hmm...</i>

175
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:07,596
So she knows that he's a nice person,

176
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:11,484
but it wouldn't work out between them.

178
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:15,941
"Practice Guide"
Saori isn't coming to see me...

179
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,941
Saori isn't coming to see me...

180
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,748
Darn it!

181
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:26,619
A street racer doesn't need a girlfriend!

182
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,198
What brought you here tonight?

183
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,035
I was on my way to an ATM

184
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:47,036
and thought I would stop
by to see your ugly face.

185
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,540
Takumi banged it up pretty good, didn't he'!

186
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:55,244
Of course, with that race, he couldn't help it.

187
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,481
That idiot... but he's heading
in the right direction.

188
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:03,085
You have a smile on your face
after he messed up your fender?

189
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,158
His style is changing.

190
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,159
He was good before, but there
was something missing.

191
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,630
Lately, he's going faster.

192
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,002
He stepped it up a notch.

193
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,004
How can you tell, Bunta'!

194
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:22,004
When you see this Eight-Six
day in and day out,

195
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,677
you can tell how he's driving.

196
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:28,227
I guess that makes sense.

197
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:36,285
I'll stop by on my way back.
Let's have a drink tonight.

198
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,122
Yeah.

199
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,367
Ta ku mi is crazy...

200
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,635
...but his dad's just as crazy.

201
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,636
He hasn't changed a bit.

but! cawtjust pass by...</i>

205
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:01,704
Um, I'm not a crazy person or anything...

206
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,741
I was just wondering
what's wrong with your car.

207
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,777
I have no idea what's going on in there.

208
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,548
No matter how much I turn the
ignition, the engine won't start.

209
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:16,218
I can take a look at it, if you don't mind.

210
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,524
I'd appreciate it.

211
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,524
It sounds like something electrical...

212
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,361
<i>Let's see...</i>

--What do you think'!
--Well...

217
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:52,657
<i>My face has never been this close</i>

219

<i>My heart can'! take this...</i>

220
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,873
<i>She is so cute!</i>

221
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,441
<i>What a nice smell!</i>

222
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,441
<i>Pm smelling a cute girl
for the first time in my life.</i>

223
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:18,533
<i>Oh, no! I hope I don'! smell like sweat!</i>

224
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:33,698
Okay, it should start now.

225
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,699
Go ahead and try the ignition.

226
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:42,140
Good!

227
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,140
Wow, it started! Amazing!

228
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,312
Thank you very much for your help.

229
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,312
You saved me.

230
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,184
No, it was nothing.

231
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,819
That's not true.

232
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,820
I respect guys who are good
with mechanical stuff.

233
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,659
I'd like to thank you later, <i>so...</i>

...can I have your number?

235
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,730
Don't worry about it, really.

236
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,135

<i>wondering what had just happened.</i>

246
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,097
This isn't a dream!

247
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,100
<i>I happened to run into an angel</i>

248
