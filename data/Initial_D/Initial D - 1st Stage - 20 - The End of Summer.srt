<i>Get ready, yo! Now we blow up the horn</i>

3
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,764
<i>in the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,501
<i>Payback for a dream I've seen so many times</i>

5
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,171
<i>My body is frozen in a
memory that! can't shake</i>

6
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,841
<i>Slam on the accelerator and deceive myself</i>

7
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,612
<i>Broken in the night</i>

8
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,748
<i>My eyes become sharper</i>

9
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,952
<i>All from someone': whim</i>

10
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,089
<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

11
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,194
<i>Break into the night, it': the time</i>

12
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,195
<i>With scared eyes, Pm lost in the night</i>

13
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,865
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

14
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,502
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

15
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,139
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

16
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,943
<i>Love me so much,
enough that! could fall apart</i>

17
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,647
<i>if only I could throw everything away</i>

18
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,284
<i>And just love you</i>

19
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,824
<i>Then I know! could face the truth</i>

20
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,915
I'm glad we came, Kenji!

21
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,521
Itsuki, this is paradise!

22
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:03,923
It's amazing!

23
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,923
Takumi!

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Come over here and swim with us.

25
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,730
Um, I'm okay...

26
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,735
Okay, we're coming!

27
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,736
What's wrong'! Come on!

28
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:22,708
We'll be right there!

29
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,709
--I'm so glad I came!
--Me, too!

30
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:26,612
"Act 20: The End of Summer" --I'm
so glad I came! --Me, too!

31
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:31,123
"Act 20: The End of Summer"

32
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,223
You're coming wth us, right'!

33
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,893
What's wrong'! Aren't you having fun'!

34
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:43,894
Yeah, sure.

35
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,297
Let's go down the slide, Takumi.

36
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,467
I think I'll just hang around here instead.

37
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,138
He's always hanging around.

38
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,474
Can we come'!

39
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:58,475
Sure.You guys can come along, too.

40
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:01,647
We can come along!

41
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,483
Okay, let's go!

42
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:04,984
Shall we go,Takumi'!

43
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,984
I'm not too good with slides...

44
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:11,554
It's nothing compared to your super drift.

45
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,295
She's always like that...

46
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,331
Forceful and single-minded.

47
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,332
I see no harm in it.

48
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,467
They're having fun.

49
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:25,468
Was it really okay for all
of you to take today off'!

50
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,606
I used a sick day. My boss wasn't too happy.

51
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,019
<i>She': so beautiful...</i>

52
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,020
<i>...that my heart may explode.</i>

53
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,090
<i>Seeing her in her swimsuit</i>

54
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:50,493
<i>is my best summer memory ever.</i>

55
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,131
<i>H! never forget it.</i>

56
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:01,004
<i>After all, she is out of my reach.</i>

57
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,776
lketani.

58
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,212
Thank you very much for everything.

59
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,213
--Well...
--I'm very grateful.

60
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:14,327
I realized many things the other night.

61
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,356
<i>Make...</i>

62
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,825
I'm sorry to have bothered you,

63
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,527
but I've decided to keep racing.

64
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,530
That's good!

65
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,530
I was hoping you wouldn't quit.

66
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:30,569
I was conceited,

67
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,910
because they labeled me "Usui's fastest."

68
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,311
We can't recover!

69
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,312
Spin away from him!

70
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:56,526
That race forced me to realize
the depth of driving technique.

71
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,334
And if I quit now,

72
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,335
I'll be leaving things unfinished.

73
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:08,840
I'm glad to hear that.

74
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,241
It's good to know what I did was useful.

75
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:19,051
Iketani'!

76
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:23,472
You remember our promise
by the lake, don't you'!

77
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,061
It came out wrong,

78
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,730
so you may have misunderstood me, but...

79
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,691
...I didn't mean it like a deal.

80
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:40,203
Would you...

81
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,440
...make me a woman'!

82
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,880
I'll be waiting for you around 8:00,

83
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,751
under that billboard where we first met.

84
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:04,663
Can we slow down'!

85
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:06,664
So cute!

86
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:11,565
<i>Her breasts are against my back...</i>

87
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,144
I have Kenji against my back...

88
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,578
This is so sad!

89
00:06:36,929 --> 00:06:38,929
No!

90
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,770
Mako, can you get the ball'!

91
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,771
Please!

92
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,855
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi!</i>

93
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,191
Ready, Sayuki?

94
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,527
Here!

95
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,529
Bad throw!

96
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,530
Sorry!

97
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,869
Bad throw.

98
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,454
<i>Why does she carry his picture?</i>

99
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,315
Anything wrong?

100
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,716
Oh, no...

101
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,156
Can I ask you a question?

102
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,028
Sure.

103
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:46,029
You said you've never
had a relationship before.

104
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,269
<i>Yes...</i>

105
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,169
But you must have had a
crush on someone, right'!

106
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,610
Sure.

107
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,610
I just wondered why you
didn't go out with him.

108
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,247
I'm sure most guys would die
for a pretty girl like you.

109
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,219
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

110
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,690
What does he do'!

111
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,110
He's a street racer, too.

112
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,298
It was about three years ago,

113
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,122
when I was still in high school...

114
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:33,042
A few of us from school went to see a race.

115
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,913
I knew nothing about street racing then,

116
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:40,083
but this one car left a
lasting impression on me.

117
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,887
Even I could see that he had
a very special talent for racing.

118
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,960
I was mesmerized by the world of racing,

119
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,797
and got hooked on it.

120
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,864
I got my license and managed to buy a car.

121
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,287
I practiced day in and day out.

122
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,690
I thought I'd feel close to him if I got better.

123
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,925
Perhaps it wasn't the right motive.

124
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:33,405
I often went to watch him race.

125
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:42,845
But I never even talked to him...

126
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:47,784
...so I'm not sure if I really
liked him in that way.

127
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,889
I can't say whether I was
admiring him, or his technique.

128
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:57,028
But you liked him.

129
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,664
I guess so.

130
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,715
I guess I liked him a lot.

131
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,170
<i>What a fraud!</i>

132
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:11,007
<i>I shouldn't have asked.</i>

133
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,474
<i>She seems far away now.</i>

134
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:25,023
<i>She was admiring a superstar...</i>

135
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:28,024
<i>The number-one racer in Gunma...</i>

136
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,581
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi.</i>

137
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:38,042
<i>Now! know why she likes FCs.</i>

138
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:46,662
<i>How can I possibly compete with him?!</i>

139
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,210
<i>He': finally ready to go
head-to-head with the Eight-Six.</i>

140
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,588
Do you want to come along?

141
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:33,556
I'll show you my "fastest racer" theory.

142
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,827
Big brother...

143
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,802
That was so much fun!

144
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,938
I never knew that going to the pool
with girls was this much fun!

145
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,643
Right, Takumi'!

146
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,714
You were mostly with Kenji, though.

147
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,150
<i>Make and Sayuki are the best, fight, Kenff!</i>

148
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:04,155
You do recover quickly.

149
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,258
Just a few days ago,

150
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,026
you were saying that racers didn't need girls.

151
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,307
Those two are different.

152
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,966
Itsuki!

153
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:21,003
All I can see is those two in their bikinis.

154
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,676
So blinding!

155
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:26,644
Sayuki': bouncing breasts are something,

156
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:29,645
but Mako': body is just incredible.

157
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,182
Right, lketani'!

158
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,553
I guess so.

159
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,490
You don't sound very convinced.

160
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,493
What's wrong'!

161
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,294
Did you two have a fight or something?

162
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,630
<i>No.</i>

163
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:48,031
I'm just tired is all.

164
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,041
Hey, what are you doing here'!

165
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,644
I'm sorry about today, boss.

166
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,647
No big deal.

167
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,647
You should enjoy your youth while it lasts.

168
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,186
I'd be worried if you only cared about cars

169
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,055
and didn't have a girlfriend.

170
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,725
--Yeah.
--Good luck.

171
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,726
Your angel's name is Mako, right'!

172
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,530
How's it going'!

173
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,200
It doesn't look too good.

174
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,038
She is definitely too good for me.

175
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:32,177
Don't be so negative.

176
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,445
<i>Listen,</i> girls <i>are like...</i>

177
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,446
No, boss, it's okay. I have no chance.

178
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:42,952
I can't compete with Ryosuke Takahashi.

179
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,428
What's that supposed to mean'!

180
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,426
<i>What': going on? I can barely follow him.</i>

181
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:05,277
<i>His FC is the same, so what's going on?</i>

182
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:24,025
<i>My theory evolves with each new piece of data.</i>

183
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,633
<i>Be patient, Eight-Six!</i>

184
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,469
<i>When my theory is complete,</i>

185
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:32,959
<i>you'll be on my "defeated" list.</i>

186
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,892
<i>“Kamameshi”</i>

187
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,302
<i>I got here first.</i>

188
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,639
<i>My heart is pumping so fast that I can't breathe.</i>

189
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,472
<i>I may die when lketani gets here.</i>

190
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:17,015
What'!

191
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:20,016
You just don't understand
women at all, do you'!

192
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,022
Listen to me.

193
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,023
It's not that she was actually dating him, is it'!

194
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,726
Every young girl has a crush on somebody.

195
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,664
It's no different than admiring idols on TV.

196
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,569
Yeah.

197
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,871
Just think about it for a minute.

198
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,872
She decided to come clean with you

199
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,010
because she chose you over him.

200
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,011
She revealed her secret to you
because she trusts you.

201
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,650
Can't you see that'!

202
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,651
Forget about your stupid inferiority complex!

203
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,822
Being in love means that you
accept everything about the person.

204
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,593
Isn't that what love is all about?!

205
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,521
Eight o'clock?!

206
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:33,522
It's half past, you idiot!

207
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,227
I won't make it.

208
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:39,228
It'll take at least an hour to get to Yokokawa.

209
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:42,465
She won't wait for me.

210
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,469
Just go!

211
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,871
You won't know that until you get there!

212
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,872
Go, or you're fired!

213
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:06,322
If you call yourself a racer,
don't let up on the gas.

214
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,739
Drive as if your life depended on it.

215
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,631
But he probably won't make it.

216
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,059
That's also part of being young.

217
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:33,251
<i>The boss is right.</i>

218
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,252
<i>Pm such an idiot!</i>

219
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,994
<i>H! never meet anyone like her again.</i>

220
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,623
<i>Why couldn't! be more honest?!</i>

221
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,805
<i>My name is Make Sate.</i>

222
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,140
Call me!

223
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:59,141
I'll give you my virginity.

224
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,880
I'll be waiting for you around 8:00,

225
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,817
under that billboard where we first met.

226
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:10,268
<i>She was always honest with me... but I...</i>

227
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,291
<i>Pm certifiable!</i>

228
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,291
My feet hurt.

229
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,569
I hate high heels.

230
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:10,112
<i>MakoJ don'! need to go to a hotel with you.</i>

231
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,719
<i>Well, I want to, but...</i>

232
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,888
<i>What am I saying?</i>

233
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:19,379
<i>I just want to see your face.</i>

234
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:23,528
<i>Please, God...</i>

235
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,564
<i>I just need one more chance!</i>

236
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:28,664
<i>Please don'! take away my angel!</i>

237
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,082
<i>Traffic? An accident? Not now!</i>

238
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,784
<i>No;</i>

239
00:19:46,785 --> 00:19:49,065
<i>Oh, God, why?!</i>

240
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:59,395
<i>Pm sorry, Make.</i>

241
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,366
I'll never wear high heels again.

242
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,553
<i>There was a time when I
wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

243
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,392
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

244
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,233
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

245
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:01,349
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

246
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,648
<i>Bloom like a red rose,
I hold you ever so tightly</i>

247
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,188
<i>All I can say is that I believe
my feelings are true</i>

248
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,995
<i>Let': enjoy our happiness...</i>

249
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:28,407
<i>Into our shining future</i>

250
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,219
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

251
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,894
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

252
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,966
<i>Bloom like a red rose,
I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

253
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,
I will never let you go</i>

254
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,480
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

255
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:19,318
<i>wand miraculous flower</i>

256
00:24:27,165 --> 00:24:29,433
<i>Ah! Takumi, what': with that bouquet?!</i>

257
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,269
<i>--Uh...
“Oh! It': from Nutsuki, isn't it?</i>

258
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,404
<i>--No...
--l get it. it was a present to you,</i>

259
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,873
<i>the driver of the Fujiwara Tofu Shop
(Private Vehicle)</i>

260
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,873
<i>black-and-white Trueno that every
racer in Gunma knows about now,</i>

261
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,244
<i>from a gaggle of girls!</i>

262
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,947
<i>--Uh, that': not right.
--Ah! So it's from Sayuki.</i>

263
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,516
<i>Sayuki was after you in a weird way, huh?</i>

264
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,517
<i>No. I got this from Ryosuke Takahashi.</i>

265
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:50,955
<i>Huh?</i>

266
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,956
<i>Next on initial D: "Challenge From a Superstar."</i>
