00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:55,841
Is it okay to drop you off
at this kind of a place'!

38
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,842
It's all right, because my house is right there.

39
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,513
You said this car was pretty sad-looking,

40
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,617
but I like this car.

41
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,019
It runs smoothly,

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,855
and it's small and cute...

43
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,289
What kind of car is this'!

44
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,691
It's a Trueno.

45
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,126
Trueno...

46
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,127
Let me ride in this Trueno again.

47
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,936
I had fun today, Takumi!

48
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,107
Bye-bye. I'll call you later.

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,377
She called you cute...

50
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,377
What are you going to do'!

51
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,732
I can keep up with RyosukeTakahashi!

52
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,363
As I thought, this GT-R is the best.

53
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,340
Even though the driver is good,

54
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:03,176
with the out-dated FC,

55
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,286
this is its limit, isn't it...'!

56
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,792
I'm Ryosuke Takahashi.

57
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,561
I'm a member of the Red Suns.

58
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,863
I know.

59
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:25,598
I'm Takeshi Nakazato.

60
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,598
I belong to a team at Mt. Myogi
called the Night Kids.

61
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,436
Takeshi Nakazato of the Night Kids...'!

62
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,437
Are you the fastest street racer
on Mt. Myogi': downhill?

63
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,440
I'm honored to be recognized by
the superstar, Ryosuke Takahashi.

64
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,412
But I've heard Nakazato of the Night Kids

65
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,679
is driving an S13, if I remember correctly...

66
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,757
It doesn't matter...

67
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,758
So what is a street racer
from Myogi doing at Akina'!

68
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,496
Hang on a minute. Let's not talk about me.

69
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,065
You belong to Akagi, don't you'!

70
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,066
Didn't we come here for the same reason?

71
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,670
I wanted to meet the Eight-Six I saw yesterday.

72
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,676
The one using the R32
tries to bite the Eight-Six'!

73
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,880
With the R32, which is
tuned for 380 horsepower...

74
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,584
What'!

75
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:20,218
I can see it easily

76
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:22,020
by looking at the exhaust

77
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,856
and its power on the straightaways.

78
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,591
But the result is obvious.

79
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,592
On the uphill, the Eight-Six
is no match for the R32.

80
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,862
On the downhill, there is no way

81
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,267
your R32 can beat the Eight-Six.

82
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,869
What did you say'!

83
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,869
Are you saying my R32 will lose
to the Eight-Six on the downhill?!

84
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,273
Don't take it personally.
I'm just saying what I think.

85
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:47,813
You don't have much nerve.

86
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,215
Even though your brother lost,

87
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,717
there's no need to be so intimidated.

88
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,885
It's just an Eight-Six.

89
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:56,655
Once you race against it, you'll see.

90
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,957
I'm the only one who can beat him.

91
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,392
Don't joke with me.

92
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:03,028
You've already said it, and now
I can't walk away no matter what.

93
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,029
I'll beat the Eight-Six and
make you eat your words.

94
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:09,000
You can be arrogant for now.

95
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:12,001
Don't forget that I am Nakazato from Myogi!

96
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,772
I'm telling you now

97
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,263
that the rotary is not a match for this R32!

98
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,223
<i>...driving an $13, if! remember correctly...</i>

99
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,920
<i>That': right... since that time, I have changed.</i>

100
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,782
<i>Damn! I can'! pass it!</i>

101
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,884
<i>Even if! get close in the comer,</i>

102
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,418
<i>he pulls away in the straightaway...</i>

103
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,419
<i>I have better technique as a racer!</i>

104
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,655
<i>Crap! How could I lose?!</i>

105
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,017
<i>With this $13, I can't beat an R32,</i>

106
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,352
<i>no matter what I do...</i>

107
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:37,353
<i>I, who was called the fastest
street racer on Mt. MyogTs downhill,</i>

108
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,707
<i>lost to an R32, which can't even do a drift...!</i>

109
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,563
<i>All cars have their limits.</i>

110
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,731
<i>No matter how excellent
the driver's technique is,</i>

111
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,634
<i>you can'! drive beyond the car': limit.</i>

112
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,825
<i>Even that Eight-Sixm!</i>

113
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,380
Good morning!

114
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,582
Hey!

115
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,351
Here, lketani!

116
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:07,052
What's that'!

117
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,554
Fried tofu.

118
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:10,322
It's left over from yesterday.

119
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,324
My father told me to bring it to you.

120
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,492
Oh, really?

121
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,660
I'll put it in the refrigerator.

122
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,441
<i>Wow... I'm surprised he thought of me...</i>

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,901
<i>"By the wayffakumi...
--Yeah...'l!</i>

124
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,737
Is it true that you've been delivering tofu

125
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,838
to Lake Akina for the last five years'!

126
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,574
<i>Yeah...</i>

127
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,574
I thought we were friends.
Why didn't you tell me'!

128
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,346
Because if I talked about it,
we could have gotten into trouble...

129
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,018
<i>Well...</i> I guess <i>so...</i>

130
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,853
Five years ago,

131
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:45,424
we were just starting junior high...

132
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,094
You've driven much longer than I have.

133
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,632
Sincejunior high,
you've been driving every day,

134
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,633
even in the snow and rain, on Mt. Akina.

135
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,570
It's early in the morning.
So I don't see anyone...

136
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,806
No, not that! Those corners!
Weren't you scared'!

137
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,311
Well... in the beginning, I was scared.

138
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,881
But the fear was completely
gone within six months.

139
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,485
When I accelerate, the tires slip naturally.

140
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,323
So it took another half year

141
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:20,323
until I could slip and control them as I wanted.

142
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:21,727
That means...

143
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,362
...you mastered the downhill in a year.

144
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:25,731
If you do it every day,

145
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,731
your nervousness about
slipping disappears quickly.

146
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,669
I had nothing to do,

147
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,670
so I started to see how close
I could get to the guardrails...

148
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,840
Would a normal person do
something that dangerous?!

149
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,577
I never thought it was dangerous.

150
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,578
When I'm at my best, I can
get as close as about 1 cm.

151
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,584
One... one centimeter?!

152
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,420
Unless I find fun stuff to do like that,

153
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,922
it's pretty boring

154
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,290
helping with my father's business.

155
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,291
That's why I've never thought I
wanted to improve as a driver...

156
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,764
But I would get impatient,

157
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,432
and would want to get home faster.

158
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,034
So when I don't have tofu on the way back,

159
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,936
I go as fast as I can.

160
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,937
--Takumi... can I ask you a question?
--Yes...

161
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:11,307
How do you drive when
you have tofu in the car'!

162
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,745
If you go too fast, you'll
damage the tofu, won't you'!

163
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,556
I can't go very fast on the uphill...

164
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,252
My father puts water in a paper cup

165
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,788
and puts it in the cup holder.

166
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,624
If I can drive without spilling the water,

167
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,145
he says I won't damage
the tofu, even if I'm going fast.

168
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:33,162
In the beginning, I found it to be very difficult.

169
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,566
Even when I drove slowly, it spilled all over...

170
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,170
I would think <i>so...</i>

171
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,739
Brake, steering wheel, shifting, gas pedal...

172
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,740
If even one of them is a
little rough, the water spills.

173
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,910
My father often says to roll
the water in the paper cup.

174
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,915
Roll the water in the cup'!

175
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,251
I suppose it's the surface tension...

176
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,820
The water's surface tension

177
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,820
makes it roll around the rim of the cup.

178
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,026
At each corner,

179
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:04,537
I roll the water to the edge
of the rim as I drive up the hill.

180
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:07,767
It took me along time

181
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:10,767
to be able to drift without spilling the water.

182
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,138
Drift without spilling the water?!

183
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:15,139
Can you really do that?!

184
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,109
Don't lie! You're just joking, right?!

185
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,312
The primary point in controlling
a car is the center of balance.

186
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:28,217
The Drift King, Keiichi Tsuchiya,
also says so in the video...

187
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,890
In order to drive without spilling
the water in the paper cup,

188
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,891
you have to master the car's center of balance.

189
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,230
Not to mention drifting...

190
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,633
It's impossible to do that!

191
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:44,069
I'm not lying!

192
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,604
Just because you beat Keisuke Takahashi...

193
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:48,604
You're carrying it way too far! I know better...

194
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,742
--Oh, a customer.
"Oops...

195
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,444
Welcome!

196
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,635
Fill it up with high octane? Yes, sir!

197
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,250
<i>Amazing, Buma...</i>

198
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,250
<i>His technique is way above
just a regular mountain racer...</i>

199
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:03,834
Thank you very much!

200
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,694
Takumi! I have a favor to ask.

201
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,363
Can you let me ride next to you

202
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,793
when you do the downhill at Akina'!

203
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,379
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

204
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,380
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"
You want to use the car'!

205
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:29,447
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"
At this time of the day'!

206
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:31,149
At this time of the day'!

207
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,918
Oh, well, I didn't think you'd let me.

208
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,120
That's all right. It's not a big deal.

209
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,821
I don't mind.

210
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,423
Are you sure'!

211
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,392
Don't you need the car for anything?

212
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,095
Like a meeting at the Chamber
of Commerce or something?

213
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,564
You'd better think a little bit.

214
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:47,832
What are you talking about?

215
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,568
You sound like you'll be in trouble
if I don't have to use the car.

216
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,569
<i>Well, no...</i> I didn't mean <i>that...</i>

217
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:55,140
Then take the car.

218
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:58,141
But in return, you need to
pick me up at my meeting.

219
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,721
So you do have a meeting!

220
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:13,458
My heart is really beating fast!

221
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,394
It's likejust before getting on the
extreme ride at the amusement park.

222
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,395
Oh, shoot! Lucky you! I'm envious!

223
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,299
I don't think it's that much fun.

224
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:26,037
I'm going, lketani.

225
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:29,038
Yeah! I can count on you,Takumi! Go all out!

226
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,241
Shoo, shoo! Get away, you guys!

227
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,383
It sounds great!

228
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,364
It's the best! A turbo can
never sound like that!

229
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:56,599
<i>The first comer is coming up.</i>

230
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,570
<i>H! figure out what he does different from me,</i>

231
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,911
<i>and then steal his technique...</i>

232
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,543
Hey...! Hey!

233
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,763
Takumi! Brake!

234
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:15,720
<i>How... How can he control the car like this?</i>

235
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,241
<i>What': going on?!</i>

236
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,393
Incredible...

237
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:27,932
<i>The speedometer warning sound is on!</i>

238
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,933
<i>That means it is way over 100 km/hr.</i>

239
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:34,291
<i>We're coming up on the next comer!</i>

240
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:09,674
The Eight-Six is back already?

241
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,209
I wonder what happened.

242
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,840
It's too early to return from the bottom.

243
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,689
He passed out...

244
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,894
Takumi!

245
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:32,895
Which corner was it'!

246
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,133
<i>The third one...'l!</i>

247
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:35,400
"lketani Passes Out!"
The third one...'!

248
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,369
"Iketani Passes Out!"
Wow! <i>I...</i> I saw it!

249
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,105
"Iketani Passes Out!" The agonized cry of
his last moment echoed through Mt. Akina!

250
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,308
"Iketani Passes Out!"
The scary downhill!

251
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,309
"Iketani Passes Out!"
lketani, in the third corner...

252
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,313
"lketani Passes Out!"

253
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,982
"lketani Passes Out!"
...passed out!

254
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:50,248
...passed out!

255
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,950
It must be true...

256
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,761
Wow! Mr. Tachibana! Why are you here?!

257
00:15:57,056 --> 00:16:00,056
I was curious...

258
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:02,392
I suppose I'm not welcome...

259
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,501
Take your time...

260
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:12,370
I know that guy.

261
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,371
Nakazato of the Night Kids
has no opponent in Myogi.

262
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,343
I can't be impressed

263
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,045
by the technique of a person who drives a R32.

264
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,014
It's just that the car is fast. That's all.

265
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,216
I wonder if that's true...

266
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,850
You don't think so, brother?

267
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,851
Here we go again. Keisuke hates the R32.

268
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,523
But, Ryosuke...

269
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,523
I don't think it's good if
Nakazato defeats him first.

270
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:38,096
If the Night Kids beat

271
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,865
the Eight-Six that we couldn't beat...

272
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:43,866
...it may look like the Red Suns
are a notch lower than the Night Kids.

273
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,539
That's the way rumors go...

274
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,540
I think that's Nakazato': plan.

275
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,046
I don't think you need to worry about it.

276
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,047
There is no one in the Night Kids
who can beat the Eight-Six.

277
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,419
As long as it's the downhill ofAkina,

278
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,354
no one can beat him.

279
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,355
Only my brother can handle it.

280
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,059
The Eight-Six is fast and on a higher level.

281
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:14,399
I don't get it...

282
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,834
Why can't the new state-of-the-art cars

283
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,835
with high power beat the Eight-Six'!

284
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:23,005
Sometimes a car has too much
power to do the job.That's all.

285
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:24,876
What?!

286
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,877
The turbo power is a strong
weapon on the straightaway,

287
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,847
but coming out of the corner,
it hinders the car's behavior.

288
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,885
It's like a double-edged sword.

289
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,287
From that aspect...

290
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,288
...once the Eight-Six is set,
it can go faster and faster.

291
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,926
On the technical courses
where the straights are short,

292
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,895
sometimes the car that
is aggressive can be faster,

293
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,696
even though it doesn't have much power.

294
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:48,199
Keisuke': turbo, which had increased power,

295
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,968
had the opposite effect...

296
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,437
That's right...

297
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,438
On the downhill ofAkina,
the total amount of time I could use...

298
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,385
...all of its 350 horses was very little.

299
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:03,748
Right after the moment I thought
I had pulled far away from him,

300
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,716
I had to brake for the next corner,

301
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:08,686
and the time it took before I could
accelerate was too long, and it irritated me.

302
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,687
Well, that is what happens
with the FR that transmits power

303
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,025
to the road surface using only the rear tires.

304
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,394
Hey, wait a minute!

305
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,394
Then what will happen
with the R32 that is a 4WD'!

306
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,665
The ATTESA E-TS System
can give stable traction

307
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,367
even when giving it the gas,

308
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,735
so he can use the turbo power

309
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,270
as much as he wants, can't he'!

310
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:30,281
Nakazato': R32 may
be able to beat the Eight-Six...

311
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:38,850
Thank you very much!

312
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,851

00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,461
But I feel strange...

316
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,433
The way I look at you has changed...

317
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,802
What's that'!

318
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,471
Have another onsen-manju ["hot spring bun"].

319
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,472
<i>Yeah...</i>

320
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,079
When you're doing that,
it's the regularTakumi.

321
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,983
A spacey guy who looks
sleepy and eats <i>manju.</i>

322
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,155
Calling me a spacey guy is pretty rude.

323
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,557
<i>But...</i>

324
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,193
...once you're in the
driver's seat of the Eight-Six

325
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,364
and jump onto the mountain...

326
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,034
...you are the pride of
the street racers in Akina!

327
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,203
The hero everyone admires!

328
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,505
Really?

329
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,706
Is that right'!

330
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:36,874
It's embarrassing...

331
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,210
I told you I'm not talking about now!

332
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,211
<i>Now you're just a spacey
guy who is eating manju.</i>

333
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,015
To tell you the truth, I feel kind of strange...

334
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,720
About what'!

335
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,422
During the last race,

336
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:54,423
and yesterday when I had lketani ride with me,

337
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,560
I was just driving as usual.

338
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:01,096
I don't understand why
everyone is so excited about it.

339
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:07,595
I've never done anything that
makes other people happy.

340
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,243
<i>Pm starting to think...</i>

341
00:20:12,244 --> 00:20:14,294
<i>...that driving is becoming fun...</i>

342
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,427
--Hey!
"What?

343
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,965
A black R32'!

344
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,734
That's the one we've seen a lot recently.

345
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,836
Crap! He's on my bumper!

346
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:41,172
Don't let it pass us! Try hard!

347
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,173
Yeah... On the downhill,
the difference in power is smaller.

348
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,796
We have the Eight-Six that beat the FD!

349
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,536
<i>Small fish!</i>

350
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,747
He passed on the outside!

351
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:35,057
What a thrill! A completely
different level of acceleration.

352
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,428
As I thought...

353
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,428
...in reality, it is impossible
to race and beat a power car...

354
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:42,355
<i>...with</i> a <i>gutless car.</i>

355
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,505
<i>This is an amazing machine.</i>

356
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,309
<i>Since I switched to this car,</i>

357
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,310
<i>my former rivals are no longer a match for me.</i>

358
00:21:55,847 --> 00:21:59,007
<i>I lost the opponents who
made me run seriously.</i>

359
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,420
<i>The drift game,</i>

360
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,421
<i>which has become popular recently
but is just flash, is not my style.</i>

361
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,458
<i>Unless it is an extreme battle,</i>

362
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,459
<i>which attacks with gripping tires
and makes me concentrate totally,</i>

363
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,064
<i>I have no use for it.</i>

364
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,466
<i>Come out!</i>

365
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,901
<i>Akina': Eight-Six!</i>

366
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,370
<i>At first glance, I felt it!</i>

367
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:22,001
<i>You are enough of an opponent for me.</i>

368
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,497
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

369

<i>Easy na motivation subete wa simulation</i>

377

<i>I heard about it!</i>

399
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:31,402
<i>You were a very famous
street racer in Akina once.</i>

400
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:34,403
<i>Yeah. I often drove with Buma.</i>

401
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,806
<i>Now in AkinmTakumi is going to have
to race with Nakazato of the Night Kids.</i>

402
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,811
<i>Yeah... But Takumi doesn't want to race.</i>

403
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,248
<i>What?! Then we can'! see them race!</i>

404
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,284
<i>Don'! worry. I have an idea.</i>

405
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,388
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

406
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,389
<i>Next time on Initial D, "A Racer': Pride."</i>
