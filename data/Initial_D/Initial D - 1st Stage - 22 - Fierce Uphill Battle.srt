There must be some way to
make Takumi stop daydreaming.

21
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,683
The race is on the 15th,

22
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:00,684
so we still have one more week.

23
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,054
It's a good thing it's not tomorrow.

24
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:07,057
Aren't the Red Suns and the
Night Kids racing tomorrow?

25
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:10,863
That's it!

26
00:02:10,864 --> 00:02:13,864
Take Takumi there and
make him watch their race!

27
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:17,202
It could be exciting enough

28
00:02:17,203 --> 00:02:20,072
to snap him out of his daydreaming!

29
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:23,073
That's a good idea.That should do the trick!

30
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,710
He'll have a rude awakening.

31
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:37,245
"Act 22: Fierce Uphill Battle!"

32
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,037
Hey, Dad, I've been thinking...

33
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,906
About what'!

34
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,907
I raced at Usui Pass the other night.

35
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:02,295
I thought it would be totally
different from Akina Pass.

36
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,785
But as I drove it...

37
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,415
...I realized that it felt very similar to Akina.

38
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,462
Very good.

39
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,896
Is it'!

40
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:20,897
Usui is a completely
different course from Akina,

41
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,768
but you ran your usual race on it.

42
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:29,638
It's about how much "Akina"
you take with you to other courses.

43
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,815
--Good luck with the deliveries.
--Okay.

44
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:58,858
<i>How much "Akina" I take with me...</i>

45
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,991
<i>I think I sort of understand
what he's trying to say.</i>

46
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,402
I need a nap.

47
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,407
He's completely lost in a daydream.

48
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,408
Okay, let the operation begin!

49
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,678
Hey,Takumi!

50
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,083
Big news! Don't freak out!

51
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:48,084
The Red Suns and the Night Kids
are battling it out tonight!

52
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,689
--So'!
--What do you mean, "so"?!

53
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,860
Since you're taking on
Ryosuke Takahashi next week,

54
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,030
this race is a must-see!

55
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,235
Okay,then!

56
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,235
Let's take your Eight-Six, since it's a
waste of gas to drive two cars there.

57
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,573
--Mine'!
--I'm getting fired up!

58
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,044
You're excited too, right'!

59
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,414
Right...

60
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:18,250
I'll meet you at your place at 7:00.

61
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,681
Don't forget to borrow the Eight-Six!

62
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,706
The crowd is huge.

63
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:42,874
Are Takumi and ltsuki here'!

64
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,610
Not yet.

65
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,611
I sure hope ltsuki was able to pull this off.

66
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:53,216
Hurry up, Takumi, or we'll miss the race.

67
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,053
We got lost because you didn't
want to take the toll road.

68
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:00,559
You're too cheap.

69
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,894
Look who's talking.

70
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,894
You're the one who didn't drive to save on gas.

71
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,119
I've never heard of a racer
with no sense of direction...

72
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,170
<i>This must be a side effect of his daydreaming.</i>

73
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,173
I got it.

74
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:19,486
We really gotta hurry!

75
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,861
You made me wait.

76
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,862
The main character shows up last.

77
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,998
Myogi': ravine is steep, so try not to die.

78
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,669
Enough.Your hands are shaking.

79
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,839
Don't worry, it'll be quick.
No Night Kid can touch me.

80
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,594
Your arrogance could end your life.

81
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,487
Let's go, before the rain starts.

82
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,523
--Yeah.
--An Eight-Six!

83
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,524
Akina': Eight-Six came!

84
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,128
<i>An Eight-Six?</i>

85
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:22,305
Check out this huge crowd!

86
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,742
Just concentrate on finding them, okay'!

87
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,646
<i>I know...</i>

88
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,647
...but it's hard to spot them in this crowd.

89
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,552
Where should we park'!

90
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,554
What about the top'!

91
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:37,390
There's a big parking lot.

92
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,970
All right, let's go up, then.

93
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,568
<i>I knew you'd come.</i>

94
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,603
<i>You're getting me fired up.</i>

95
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,854
<i>Eight-Six, I'll show you
how much I've improved.</i>

96
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,047
--An Eight-Six!
--You mean Akina's'!

97
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,158
--Yeah.
--Is it really?

98
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,054
HeyTakumi, is it just me,

99
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,055
or do you think people are looking at us'!

100
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,260
--Yeah.
--What do you mean, "yeah"?!

101
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:18,261
They totally recognize us.

102
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:21,297
Akina': Eight-Six is famous now.

103
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,868
They have their eye on you, you know'!

104
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:28,538
It was a good idea to drive the Eight-Six here.

105
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,641
What are you muttering about?

106
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:34,613
Okay, come forward!

107
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,614
Forward!

108
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,490
Okay.The road is clear!

109
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,228
I'll count down!

110
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,296
<i>Five... Four...</i>

111
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,465
<i>Three... Two...</i>

112
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,466
<i>One... Go!</i>

113
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:07,612
Wow! What a fast start!

114
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,613
<i>I know Keisuke will win.</i>

115
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,510
<i>Don'! lose. it': not an option on our turf.</i>

116
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,525
"Takahashi"

117
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,795
It's started.

118
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,766
<i>Rain...</i>

119
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,869
<i>The FD': best weapon is
its high cornering speed.</i>

120
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,969
<i>Don'! forget that, Keisuke.</i>

121
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,715
Takumi'!

122
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:45,715
Don't you think Myogi Pass
is similar to Akina Pass'!

123
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,886
I don't know.

124
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,887
It seems more like Usui Pass to me.

125
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:54,225
It's nothing like Usui!

126
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:58,326
<i>It's no use. He's totally lost,
out in the deepest sea.</i>

127
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,534
Take a good look at it!

128
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,336
It's not as narrow as Usui,

129
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,337
and this uphill is just like Akina's.

130
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,874
I mean the rhythm is similar.

131
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,561
Rhythm...'!

132
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,675
<i>Be careful! An FD is quick around comers.</i>

133
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,769
<i>I never thought anyone could
follow me up Myogi': hill.</i>

134
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,256
<i>He's starting to abuse the steering.</i>

135
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,725
<i>He': trying to speed away.</i>

136
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,796
<i>If he did that on a downhill,
the tires would compress.</i>

137
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,848
They just passed the mid-point.

138
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,317
The R32 is in front...

139
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,318
...but it's very close.

140
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,423
I see.

141
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,191
Tell me one thing...

142
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,192
How did Keisuke look coming out of the turn'!

143
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,196
He was one step slower than Nakazato,

144
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,866
but overall, he seems under
control and very smooth,

145
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:21,137
unlike Nakazato's aggressive
but inconsistent run.

146
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,668
I got it. Thanks.

147
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:30,213
<i>You've improved, Keisuke,
to be able to race like that.</i>

148
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,485
The R32 is in front.Very tight!

149
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,489
They just passed me.
Nakazato is barely in front.

150
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:44,162
It sounds like Takeshi is doing well.

151
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,031
He's been training hard.

152
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,032
He became a different person
after losing to the Eight-Six.

153
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,570
<i>I've always considered Takeshi
to be my enemy. But now...</i>

154
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,877
<i>Knowing that he's fighting for
our pride, I feel the camaraderie.</i>

155
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,203
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

156
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,822
The R32': in the lead!

157
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,073
Win,Takeshi! I'm counting on you!

158
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:23,902
I can hear the squeals, but I can't see them.

159
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,439
What'!

160
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,439
Rain...

161
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,945
Oh, no! They're battling at full speed!

162
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,783
It's most dangerous
when it first starts raining.

163
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,784
The rain lifts up the dirt and oil on
the surface and makes it slippery.

164
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,455
They could easily crash.

165
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,303
<i>Raindrops...</i>

166
00:13:58,304 --> 00:14:01,206
<i>Darn, couldn't it have waited?</i>

167
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,408
<i>I gotta be alert.</i>

168
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,339
<i>I could lose control without warning.</i>

169
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:40,411
It's really coming down.

170
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:43,042
I hope they don't stop the race.

171
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,085
--Hey, ltsuki'!
--Yeah'!

172
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,086
Since that's the finish line,
this must be the last corner, right'!

173
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,358
Yeah.

174
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,359
That's the highest point in Myogi Pass,

175
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,862
so this is a downhill corner.

176
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,199
The only downhill corner.

177
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,669
Here they come!

178
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,194
<i>This is it!</i>

179
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:35,055
<i>That': suicidal! You'll crash
into the wall at that speed!</i>

180
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,176
<i>I know! can do this!</i>

181
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:47,807
<i>My FD': telling me I can!</i>

182
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,391
They're coming at us!

183
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,380
The FD won!

184
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:28,286
I'm so impressed!

185
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,287
Man, Keisuke Takahashi is good!

186
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,590
<i>This is the first time that I
was inspired by other racers.</i>

187
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:41,969
<i>Seeing a great race like
that makes me restless.</i>

188
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,139
You got lucky, Keisuke Takahashi.

189
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:52,444
No, it was skill.

190
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,912
What'!

191
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,912
The last corner was downhill,

192
00:16:57,082 --> 00:17:00,082
so I knew it would come
down to the front tires.

193
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,554
You couldn't quite control them

194
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:06,555
because they were too compressed.

195
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:09,925
I kept up my speed,
but maintained the tire pressure.

196
00:17:11,663 --> 00:17:13,683
It was skill.

197
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:35,019
You did it, Keisuke!

198
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,788
Should we do a downhill race'!

199
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:39,624
We can't keep going in this rain.

200
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,926
"Right.
--Then, Keisuke...

201
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,927
--...please let me race the Eight-Six.
"What?

202
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,364
This isn't Akagi or his home course,

203
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,436
so this is as fair as it gets.

204
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,005
--Hey.
--lketani.

205
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:54,840
Who is he'!

206
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,940
--No idea.
--Kenta!

207
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,522
Takumi Fujiwara, isn't it'!

208
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,384
Kenta Nakamura of the Red Suns.

209
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,385
How about me and you in this rain'!

210
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:12,390
We gotta talk to my brother first.

211
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,226
Let's ask the spectators, Keisuke.

212
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,227
Wanna see us battle it out in the rain?!

213
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:22,254
--Yeah!
--Come on!

214
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:27,536
--Darn.
--Hard to say no now.

215
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,040
But he's racing against
Ryosuke Takahashi next week.

216
00:18:32,678 --> 00:18:34,212
I'm first.

217
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,213
If you can't beat me, you're
certainly not worth Ryosuke': time.

218
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:42,053
What do you say'!

219
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,722
I love racing in the rain.

220
00:18:44,723 --> 00:18:47,723
Don't tell me you're scared of the rain'!

221
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,395
No, not now!

222
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:54,396
He hasn't, uh, been himself lately.

223
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,734
Sure, why not'!

224
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,165
Wow,

225
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,276
--Hold it.
--No one can stop it now.

226
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,779
--But...
--He's not anyone': "private" target.

227
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,751
Every racer wants a piece of him.

228
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:19,421
I know you understand that feeling.

229
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,427
That's more like it.

230
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,427
Downhill in the rain.
That makes it a pure skill race.

231
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,282
Set your proud Eight-Six next to mine.

232
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,472
--Let's go, ltsuki.
--I'm going, too'!

233
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,473
If I leave you here, I'll have
to come back up afterwards.

234
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,758
Let's just race down and go straight home.

235
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,385
So, I'm getting in, then'!

236
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:50,386
Wait, ltsuki, do you mind sitting in the back'!

237
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,063
In the back'! Okay, I guess.

238
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,929
Is this a strategy?

239
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,930
<i>Maybe it is... maybe it isn't.</i>

240
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,768
What'! You don't know yourself?

241
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,140
How do I stay seated when you drift?

242
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,141
--You'll manage.
--What'!! Hey!

243
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,444
It's only from here to the
bottom of the mountain.

244
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,417
It's not over.There's one more race.

245
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,258
I hear Akina': Eight-Six is racing!

246
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,624
No oncoming traffic!

247
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,625
Let's do this!

248
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:32,430
I wasn't expecting this.

249
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Yeah. But there's nothing we can do now.

250
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,702
Don't worry, Keisuke.

251
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:40,004
Ilike rain.

252
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,005
Before I joined the team,
I purposely waited for rainy days

253
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,142
to practice my drifting technique.

254
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:51,146
The rain reduces the wear on the tires.

255
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:54,783
I see you're confident,
but don't take it lightly.

256
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:58,022
I'm the most experienced in the rain.

257
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,023
I know I'm better than him in the rain,

258
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:04,947
because the rain is on my side.

259
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,501
Takumi, you don't look too sharp.

260
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,505
Are you sure you'll be okay in the rain'!

261
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,343
Who knows'!

262
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,343
I can't go too fast in the rain,
so I'll drive normally.

263
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,048
Who knows if I'll be fast or slow'!

264
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,720
I'll take it easy,

265
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,720
'cause if I crashed, my dad would kill me.

266
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,991
That's true.

267
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:38,927
<i>Bu! if he loses this race,
there won't be a race against...</i>

268
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,065
<i>...Ryosuke Takahashi!</i>

269
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,003
I'll count down!

270
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,106
<i>Five... Four...</i>

271
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,041
<i>Three... Two...</i>

272
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,232
<i>One... Go!</i>

273
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,523
Ouch!

274
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:22,501
This isn't... normal!

275
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,553

<i>You seem confident in the min, Kentu.</i>

290
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,735
<i>Yes, I am confident.</i>

291
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:33,735
<i>H! win because Keisuke is watching me.</i>

292
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,440
<i>But even Keisuke lost to this Eight-Six.</i>

293
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,441
<i>Pm avenging that loss! This is for Keisuke.</i>

<i>Kama, do you have feelings for Keisuke?</i>

297

<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
