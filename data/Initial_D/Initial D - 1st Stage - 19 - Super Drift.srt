He couldn't have!

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,680
We already knew how great he was.

33
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,834
But since this is my last race...

34
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:39,389
...we can't quit without giving it our best!

35

What are you, scared?!

36
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,297
You're useless!

37

<i>because I was too conscious of him.</i>

62

<i>Deep down, I believed that no racer</i>

63

<i>could follow us, no matter how great he was.</i>

<i>H! never look back again.</i>

67
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,967
Drift here!

68
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,316
There can't be many turns left.

69
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:52,584
Yeah.

70
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,585
I wonder if he's still chasing her'!

71
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,255
To be honest, I thought the
race would end a lot sooner.

72
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,627
No way!

73
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,295
Even if he can't pass her this time,

74
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,464
he'll win the next race.

75
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,133
He can't pass her.

76
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,801
I'm amazed he's still in the race.

77
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:14,632
He just had to be the cat on this new course.

78
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:27,213
Wow, it started!

79
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,157
<i>My name is Make Sate.</i>

80

Sorry about that...

82
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,633
To make this summer memorable,

83
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,634
I would like to race
Akina': Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

84
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:48,940
That's my wish.

85
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,941
In return for my wish...

86
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,909
...I'll give you my virginity.

87
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,192

88
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,194
What'!

89
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,194
You were spacing out.

90
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,197
It's so obvious that you
were thinking about Mako.

91
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:19,002
It's not like that!

92
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,907
No need to hide it.

93
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,098
I have to admit that she's a cool girl.

94
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,180
<i>Kenh...</i>

95
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,349
I don't know the details,

96
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,349
but after this race,
you should give it another try.

97
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,484
You'd be a fool to let her go so easily.

98
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,526
I don't care.

99
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,450
Drift here!

100
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,103
There's a car ahead,

101
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,938
but it's still three turns away,

102
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,707
so enter this turn at full speed!

103
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,818
Okay, Sayuki.

104
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,671
Get ready for the car.

105
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,103
It sounds like a race.

106
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,139
Really? I wanna see!

107
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,889
Their downhill technique will
show you how good they are.

108
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,919
Amazing...

109
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,763
lcalled it!

110
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:27,764
<i>Sayuki can time oncoming traffic perfectly.</i>

111
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,634
<i>She can spot the distant headlights
flashing through the leaves.</i>

112
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,484
"Grip" and stay inside!

113
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:53,256
<i>Good job, Make. You're right on.</i>

114
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,461
Drift right through here!

115
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:26,059
No cars ahead! Drift again!

116
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:37,734
<i>Amazing. Maybe too amazing...</i>

117
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,904
<i>Good racers always leave room for error.</i>

118
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,710
<i>It may look like they're exceeding their limits,</i>

119
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,947
<i>but they only use full
"wheel grip" when exiting a tum.</i>

120
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,784
<i>They ease up on the "wheel grip"
when braking into a tum,</i>

121
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:01,556
<i>because one mistake on an
unforgiving course means a crash.</i>

122
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,199
<i>But...</i>

123
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
<i>...she has no margin for error right now.</i>

124
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:15,108
<i>She is too focused to even realize it.</i>

125
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,249
<i>Should I mention it to her...</i>

126
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,619
<i>...or not?</i>

127
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:34,353
<i>It': my job to let her know.</i>

128
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,405
<i>However...</i>

129
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,405
<i>...I don'! want to say anything
to mess up her perfect run.</i>

130
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,145
<i>I've decided.</i>

131
00:11:53,145 --> 00:11:55,647
<i>We're the best team.</i>

132
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:58,648
<i>How can I not believe in her?</i>

133
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:02,161
<i>This is her best race ever.</i>

134
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,637
<i>Man, what a charge!</i>

135
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,043
<i>She picked up the pace again.</i>

136
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,044
<i>Any faster, and H! exceed my limit.</i>

137
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:33,015
<i>Even now, Pm barely in control,
abusing all four tires...</i>

138
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,661
<i>Darn, I may not make it...</i>

139
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,918
This is our last chance to shake him off.

140
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,089
I know.

141
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,580
No cars ahead! Go for it!

142
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,015
<i>He': not following...</i>

143
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,015
<i>Why not?</i>

144
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,419
Mako, you're going in too sharp!

145
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:08,307
We can't recover! Spin away from him!

146
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,111
<i>Oh, man!</i>

147
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,112
<i>Please don'! hit us!</i>

148
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,000
--We're saved.
--Brilliant.

149
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,033
We lost.

150
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,734
He's so skilled...

151
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,395
...that I almost hate him.

152
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,174
How do you feel'!

153
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,280
<i>We lost...</i>

154
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,301
...but I feel very satisfied.

155
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:31,895
It reminded me of the excitement
I felt when I first started racing.

156
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:45,034
We would practice until sunrise.

157
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,608
That same pure sensation...

158
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:55,947
You went too far at the end,

159
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,616
but you were great until then.

160
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:01,617
The best race ever.

161
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,156
Sayuki...

162
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:07,156
Whatever you decide to do from now on,

163
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,573
just know that you have my blessing.

164
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,966
Thanks, Sayuki.

165
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:17,635
<i>No need (or tears, Make.</i>

166
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,446
Let's just enjoy this glorious moment.

167
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,652
They're back!

168
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:45,530
I wonder how the race went'!

169
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,531
You think they're going again'!

170
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,535
Probably...

171
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,442
Takumi!

172
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,787
Takumi...

173
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,988
I find it hard to believe, but...

174
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,419
I guess we won't need the second race, huh'!

175
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:19,218
No second race. It's all over.

176
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,467
I knew it.

177
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,702
Even for Takumi...

178
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:31,623
No... I didn't want to see him lose like this.

179
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,849
We lost.

180
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,018
Come again'!

181
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:42,253
What did you just say'!

182
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,254
I said we lost.

183
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,358
Don't make me repeat it.

184
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,327
He's the winner.

185
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,328
What?!

186
00:18:55,167 --> 00:19:01,817
“Yaw
“wow!

187
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,448
I never imagined we could
lose on our own turf.

188
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,886
All I did was follow you,
and I barely did that,

189
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,924
so I don't think I really won the race.

190
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,795
Don't be so modest.

191
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:28,716
With your skills, you have
the right to rub it in.

192
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:31,970
<i>But...</i>

193
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,705
We've put in hours of practice here,

194
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,408
so we were very confident.

195
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:40,409
You chose to chase us,

196
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,047
and we couldn't shake you off.

197
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,449
We accept our defeat, right, Mako'!

198
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,985
Yeah.

199
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,986
<i>Make...</i>

200
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,993
That was by far the best race ever.

201
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,994
Thanks.

202
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,008
You're blushing big time.

203
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:17,015
You're a mystery.

204
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:20,015
Your racing ability is extraordinary,

205
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,954
but otherwise you barely seem ordinary.

206
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,157
This is how he usually is.

207
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,958
When he's not racing,

208
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,959
we can't tell if he's awake or asleep.

209
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:32,697
Hey, thanks a lot.

210
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:34,499
Itsuki': right, though.

211
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:39,069
Anyhow, I'm amazed how
young and good you really are.

212
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:47,044
<i>You should give it another try.</i>

213
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,975
<i>You'd be a fool to let her go so easily.</i>

214
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:55,352
lketani.

215
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,624
Thank you for tonight...

216
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,695
<i>Mako, I...</i>

217
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,501
Don't be depressed, lketani!

218
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,342
Racers don't need girls, right'!

219
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,847
Right...

220
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,219
<i>Actually, he has a really adorable face.</i>

221
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,724
Hey, what's your name, anyway?

222
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,528
--Takumi Fujiwara...
--ltsuki Takeuchi, 18!

223
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,533
I'm an Aries and type O,
and my favorite car <i>is...</i>

224
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,920
I don't think I asked you...

225
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,543
Anyway, since we're friends now,

226
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,415
how about going swimming
together sometime?

227
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,618
That sounds great!

228
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,620
Kenji?

229
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,620
--Sure.
--How about you, Takumi'!

230
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,524
--Yeah...
--You, too, lketani'!

231
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:14,525
Yay! Thank you, Sayuki!

232
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:21,951
Let's go wild and crazy with my Eight-Five!

233
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,553
<i>There was a time when I
wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

234
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,392
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

235
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,233
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

236
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:01,349
<i>And charmed by innocent eyes</i>

237
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:06,648
<i>Bloom like a red rose,
I hold you ever so tightly</i>

238
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:13,188
<i>All I can say is that I believe
my feelings are true</i>

239
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,995
<i>Let': enjoy our happiness...</i>

240
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:28,407
<i>Into our shining future</i>

241
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:44,219
<i>We'll prove countless times...</i>

242
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,894
<i>Our passion will last for eternity!</i>

243
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,966
<i>Bloom like a red rose,
I embrace you ever so tightly</i>

244
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
<i>Even if I lose everything that I have,
I will never let you go</i>

245
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,480
<i>Bloom, my beautiful...</i>

246
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:19,318
<i>wand miraculous flower</i>

247
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,665
<i>If men weren't honest with themselves,</i>

248
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,903
<i>mankind would've been extinct long ago.</i>

249
00:24:32,904 --> 00:24:34,739
<i>You're right, boss!</i>

250
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,174
<i>The beginning of a relationship is important.</i>

251
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,175
<i>Make sure that you don't...</i>

252
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,279
<i>Hi, Honey. Pm on my way...</i>

253
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:48,283
<i>Leaving, boss? Make sure you don'! what?</i>

254
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:51,286
<i>Next on initial D: "The End of Summer."</i>

255
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:55,183
<i>Make sure you don'! miss it!</i>
