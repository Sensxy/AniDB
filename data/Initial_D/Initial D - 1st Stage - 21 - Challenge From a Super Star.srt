3
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,764
<i>in the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

4

<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

14
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,502
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

15
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,139
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

16
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,943
<i>Love me so much,
enough that! could fall apart</i>

17
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,647
<i>if only I could throw everything away</i>

18
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,284
<i>And just love you</i>

19
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,824
<i>Then I know! could face the truth</i>

20
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:38,497
Vroom!

21
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,033
And at the corner I went...

22
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,869
Voosh!

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,171
<i>...as</i> I <i>cleared it.</i>

24
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:48,171
At that moment, I was like the wind.

25
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,176
Nothing beats the pass.

26
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:54,177
When you have your own cars, go check it out.

27
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:58,215
My car'! It's an Eight-Five,
every racer': dream car!

00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,038
--Why?
__"why?"

32
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,041
Because I bought a car,

33
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:25,041
and you debuted in the
racing world like a comet.

34
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,280
Don't tease me like that.

35
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,682
One, two, three, four...

36
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,017
What are you counting?

37
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,018
Four is the number of
races you won this summer.

38
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:40,327
First, Keisuke Takahashi of the Red Suns' FD.

39
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:52,348
Second, Nakazato of the Night Kids' R32.

40
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:07,663
Third, the duct tape death match
with Shingo Shoji': EG6.

41
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,700
Finally, Mako and Sayuki':
Sileighty at Usui Pass.

42
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,310
Four for four.

43
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,311
Your undefeated legend began this summer.

44
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,415
You're no longerjust a dummy.

45
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:42,087
Stop exaggerating.

46
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:43,589
Don't be embarrassed!

47
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,024
Keep winning,Takumi!

48
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,493
Until I beat you,

49
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:51,494
and become the fastest in Gunma--
no, in all of Kanto!

50
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,166
They'll be calling me... "ltsuki, Akina': Comet"!

51
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,204
Huh?

52
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,541
Since school ends early today,

53
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,064
let's go do something in the afternoon.

54
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,648
I kind of have to work in the afternoon.

55
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,152
What'! You do'!

56
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,153
I want to ride in your car again...

57
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,059
...because it's very cute.

58
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,059
If you say <i>so...</i> but it's my dad's car.

59
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:28,200
You said you wanted to buy a car.

60
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,169
Are you saving up?

61
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,006
I save most of what I make,

62
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,008
but I'm still far from it.

63
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,343
How much do you need'!

64
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,344
Around a million yen.

65
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,516
A million...

66
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,519
How much do you have now'!

67
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,569
Not even close.

68
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,691
Takumi'!

69
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,692
What would you do if I gave you the money?

70
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,829
I wonder...

71
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,567
I bet you'd thank me,

72
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,567
and treat me like a princess.

73
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,571
You'd owe me big,

74
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:11,741
so you'd have to quit working

75
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,546
and take care of me and love me every day!

76
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,547
--I'm so embarrassed!
--Quit kidding around.

77
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,051
That's too much money
for us to come up with.

78
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,524
I know that!

79
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,025
I was just wondering.

80
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:30,026
You have no imagination.

81
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,944
That's too far off to imagine.

82
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:38,537
We now know that Takumi':
technique is the real deal

83
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,139
and will hold up anywhere.

84
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,875
It's more than just technique.

85
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,711
--Thank you very much.
--You need natural talent

86
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:48,712
to be able to race well on a new course.

87
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,382
He's a genius because he
defeated all those modern cars

88
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,154
with his ten-year-old Eight-Six.

89
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,824
--How gratifying!
--Get a load of you!

90
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,825
You're the one who said he
couldn't compete anywhere else

91
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,663
because he only knew Akina.

92
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,499
I know I did, but...

93
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,335
We all thought that.

94
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,003
Takumi is abnormal.

95
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,003
When I heard the news,
I was sure he'd lose at Usui

96
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,784
against Mako': Sileighty.

97
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,179
Sorry, lketani.

98
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:22,347
Don't worry about it.

99
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,348
I've decided to go by
"lketani the Lonely Driver."

100
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,069
That name sounds familiar.

101
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,525
Welcome.

102
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,363
Flowers?

103
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,098
Are you sure this isn't a mistake?

104
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,319
This is a gas station...

105
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,005
Takumi, this is for you.

106
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:49,107
Who is it from'!

107
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,943
From Ryosuke Takahashi.

108
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,345
What?!

109
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,181
Ryosuke...

110
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,382
...Takahashi.

111
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:59,382
From the number-one superstar in Gunma...

112
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,619
...to Ta ku mi!

113
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,826
What does it say'!

114
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:07,993
Let me see.

115
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:08,627
"To Panda Trueno 9X1510:00 PM, Mt.
Akina Peak" Let me see.

116
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:11,628
"To Panda Trueno 9X1510:00 PM, Mt.
Akina Peak" September 15th at 10 PM...

117
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,899
"To Panda Trueno 9X1510:00 PM, Mt. Akina
Peak" ...at the top of Mount Akina.

118
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,900
...at the top of Mount Akina.

119
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,503
Is that all it says'!

120
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:21,504
<i>It</i> sounds <i>like...</i>

121
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,076
It's finally here.

122
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:26,011
A challenge from Ryosuke Takahashi

123
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,814
for a downhill battle.

124
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:31,216
Wow,

125
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,052
What are you gonna do'!

126
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,052
You know he has to accept the challenge.

127
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,722
Takumi already smoked
Ryosuke': brother Keisuke.

128
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,660
That's right. Avoiding a rematch

129
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,830
is more humiliating than losing one.

130
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:02,848
What's the matter?

131
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,849
Don't you like being with me'!

132
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:09,352
--Of course I do!
--You seem uninterested and preoccupied.

133
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,092
That's normal, I guess.

134
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:17,062
You seem so far away.

135
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,564
If this isn't fun, we should go.

136
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,199
It is fun!

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,200
Sorry, I apologize.

138
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:28,213
I'll forgive you if you tell me
what you were thinking about.

139
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:33,916
Well, I don't think you would really get it.

140
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,772
--Bye!
--Okay, I'll tell you!

141
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:43,889
A battle'!

142
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,890
--Yeah.
--Is that like a fistfight?

143
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,126
No. A battle is a car race.

144
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,841
A <i>car race'!</i>

145
00:08:56,335 --> 00:08:59,335
I never knew that racing was your hobby.

146
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,839
It's not really my hobby, but I
guess it's kind of become one.

147
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,478
My next opponent is very
good and very well known.

148
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:13,516
I've been thinking about it since this morning.

149
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,754
I must be feeling the pressure.

150
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,024
You're a good driver, so you'll be okay.

151
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,462
It's not that easy.

152
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:27,463
If you don't want to race,just ignore him.

153
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,168
It's not that I don't want to.

154
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,504
I may lose to him,

155
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,645
but I don't want to not race him.

156
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,292
That's so like you.

157
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,880
You want to do it deep down, don't you'!

158
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,884
You don't show it,

159
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,885
but I know you're very competitive.

160
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,289
I kind of like that about you.

161
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,571
Ready t0 go?

162
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,576
Why don't we talk a little more before we go'!

163
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:17,514
Sure.

164
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:49,391
I know why you got in a fight
with that senior in the locker room.

165
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,419
After you quit the team,

166
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,420
your teammate told me why.

167
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:01,883
You stood up for me, didn't you'!

168
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,765
I'm sorry I misunderstood you.

169
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,936
Don't be.

170
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,537
It doesn't matter now.

171
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,558
<i>ThatkTakumvs Eight-Six.</i>

172
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,405
Who is that girl'!

173
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,982
Man, Keiichi Tsuchiya': drift is incredible!

174
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:08,187
Look.

175
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:11,187
Look at these pictures.

176
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,883
Takumi'! Hey,Takumi!

177
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,528
What is it, ltsuki'! Lunchtime?

178
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,331
You idiot!

179
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:25,148
Sorry, I was just talking to myself.

180
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,409
Takumi': been acting weird?

181
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,845
What's so weird?

182
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,514
He seems out of it.

183
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,182
That's normal.

184
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,183
I know, but he was better during the summer.

185
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,887
But when school started,

186
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,057
he suddenly got even worse than before.

187
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,028
Tired from all the races?

188
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,364
He just started racing this summer.

189
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,634
He may have lost his focus because of school.

190
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,739
I don't think that's it.

191
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:07,577
It's like something in his head broke.

192
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:11,567
Is he gonna be able to race like that'!

193
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,386
He has a girlfriend, doesn't he'!

194
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,625
What are you talking about?

195
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,626
I just thought he might
be daydreaming about her.

196
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,998
Daydreaming?

197
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:29,999
Just like how you were with Mako...

198
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,970
Kenji... that name is taboo here.

199
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,068
It's all right, ltsuki.

200
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:44,013
Anyway, I happened to see
Takumi driving with a girl.

201
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,119
Are you serious?!

202
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,120
I just got a glimpse, but she was pretty.

203
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,781
Takumi': girlfriend...

204
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,271
No wonder he's been
ditching me after school lately.

205
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,011
That traitor!

206
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,012
I've never even held a girl's hand!

207
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,351
That's it! That must be the reason!

208
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,786
I'm positive!

209
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:23,622
Leave it to me!

210
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,491
I'll take him out and interrogate him!

211
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:29,492
Racers don't need girls, right, lketani?!

212
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,531
Right!

213
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,531
We are the "Lonely Drivers"!

214
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,502
This is sad.

215
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,322
What's on your mind'!

216
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,727
You've been...

217
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,267
...dating Mogi behind my
back lately, haven't you'!

218
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:09,534
Oh, is that all'!

219
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,769
"Is that all"?!

220
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,037
It's no secret.

221
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,038
But nothing special to tell, either.

222
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,821
No excuses! Just answer this question...

223
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,846
How far did you go?

224
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:28,017
Honestly, how far did you guys go'!

225
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:30,922
How fa r'!

226
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,391
Be honest with your best friend!

227
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,502
Itsuki, watch out!

228
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,234
I'll tell you!

229
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,869
Then tell me!

230
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,304
Last Sunday...

231
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,539
Sunday!

232
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,309
<i>...the two of us...</i>

233
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,911
The two of you...!

234
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,911
...went to Akina Lake.

235
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,088
Hey, ltsuki, watch out!

236
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,989
<i>What</i> I mean <i>is...</i>

237
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,990
...which base did you get to, you idiot?

238
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,104
Which base'!

239
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,232
Did you kiss her'!

240
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:19,802
--Sure.
--What?!

241
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:22,573
Hey, ltsuki, stop!

242
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,574
Stop the car!

243
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:33,649
<i>Yeah, he': daydreaming about her.</i>

244
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,455
Why are you staring at me'!

245
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,689
You've been weird lately.

246
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,591
I have'!

247
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:42,660
You never think much,

248
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,661
yet you've been so preoccupied.

249
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:49,165
I guess so.

250
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,334
<i>He probably can'! stop
thinking about Mogi': soft lips.</i>

251
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:57,209
I've been wondering...

252
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,209
...what's gonna happen to us in the future.

253
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,181
In the future?!

254
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,650
<i>After kissing comes...</i>

255
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,651
How can you even bring up
such a shameful subject

256
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,221
in front of the "Lonely Driver"?!

257
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,414
There's only one thing left to do after kissing!

258
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:20,064
What's the one thing?

259
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:22,000
You know-- it!

260
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,868
What are you talking about?!

261
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,871
You're not making any sense.

262
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:28,871
What I mean by the future <i>is...</i>

263
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,008
Never mind. Difficult thoughts
aren't my specialty.

264
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:38,147
<i>L! looks like his daydreaming
can't be easily fixed.</i>

265
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:39,817
<i>“Welcome toTouge Alkikude: 143Am“ I! looks
like his daydreaming can't be easily fixed.</i>

266
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:45,418
"Welcome to Touge
Altitude: 1434m"

267
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,182
No wonder.

268
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:14,183
It's Keisuke': FD and Kenta': S14.

269
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,721
Kenta is fast down the hill.

270
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,722
His non-turbo S14 is made for it.

271
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,393
Keisuke took him under his wing

272
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,062
and has been personally training him.

273
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,903
He's our number-two successor.

274
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,638
The battle against the
Night Kids is in two days.

275
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,874
Keisuke shouldn't be wasting time with Kenta.

276
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,812
He must be confident.

277
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,813
I guess Takeshi Nakazato is easy prey.

278
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,284
Keisuke': on fire lately.

279
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,921
Don't you think he's been
driving like Ryosuke lately?

280
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,758
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

281
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,761
Ryosuke must be feeling pretty
confident about his brother.

282
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:04,479
I heard that's why he's not coming to Myogi.

283
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,448
Can I ask you one thing, Keisuke'!

284
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,120
What is it'!

285
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Why aren't we challenging the Eight-Six'!

286
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,813
We should have him
come to Akagi for revenge.

287
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,930
--Akagi, huh'!
--Sure!

288
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:35,931
There's no way you'll lose
to the Eight-Six on our turf.

289
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,871
If you won't do it...

290
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,306
<i>...I will!</i>

291
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,775
"Forget it, Kenta.
--Why'!

292
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,111
You think he'll beat me'!

293
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,947
Not on Akagi': downhill.

294
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,882
That's beside the point.

295
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,883
You're a Red Sun now, and don't forget it.

296
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:58,721
We race on our opponents' courses.

297
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,693
I know we do...

298
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,363
...but I can't take it.

299
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,999
The Eight-Six got the best of us!

300
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
If only we could battle fair and square...

301
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,639
Please let me take him!

302
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,640
Be patient!

303
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,515
Don't worry.

304
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,916
When the opportunity arises,

305
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,917
the person who needs to put
an end to it will do just that.

306
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,157
You mean...

307
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,859
...Ryosuke will'!

308
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,860
Be patient. First, the Night Kids race.

309
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,490
Just leave everything to us.

310
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:04,122
He does seem weird.

311
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:07,058
See?! He confessed.

312
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,061
He is, indeed, daydreaming.

313
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,063
We gotta do something.

314
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,063
We only have one week until the big race.

315
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,831
We're in serious trouble.

316
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:24,231
"To Panda Trueno 9X1510:00 PM, Mt.
Akina Peak From Ryosuke Takahashi"

317
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,553
<i>There was a time when I
wandered aimlessly, tired of love</i>

318
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,392
<i>I lost sight of myself and gave in to desire</i>

319
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:51,233
<i>But destiny is ever-changing</i>

320

00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,995
<i>Let': enjoy our happiness...</i>

324
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:28,407
<i>Into our shining future</i>
