2
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:17,321
<i>Get ready, yo! Now we blow up the horn</i>

3
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:33,764
<i>in the silver smoke amidst the frozen city</i>

4
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,501
<i>Payback for a dream I've seen so many times</i>

5
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:41,171
<i>My body is frozen in a
memory that! can't shake</i>

6
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,841
<i>Slam on the accelerator and deceive myself</i>

7
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:48,612
<i>Broken in the night</i>

8
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,748
<i>My eyes become sharper</i>

9
00:00:52,952 --> 00:00:55,952
<i>All from someone': whim</i>

10
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:59,089
<i>It seems like the world will end any minute</i>

11
00:01:00,326 --> 00:01:02,194
<i>Break into the night, it': the time</i>

12
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:05,195
<i>With scared eyes, Pm lost in the night</i>

13
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,865
<i>Embraced by a falling dream</i>

14
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:12,502
<i>Scared of being alone, missin' my heart</i>

15
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:16,139
<i>Even hurting myself</i>

16
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,943
<i>Love me so much,
enough that! could fall apart</i>

17
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:23,647
<i>if only I could throw everything away</i>

18
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:27,284
<i>And just love you</i>

19
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,824
<i>Then I know! could face the truth</i>

20
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:08,398
<i>Pm going at full power,
and he's right on my tail!</i>

21
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:12,673
<i>No matter how fast I 90,! still can't get away!</i>

22
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,603
<i>It's</i> no good.

23
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,539
<i>I might lose this race!</i>

24
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,908
<i>Ryosuke Takahashi...</i>

25
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:25,909
<i>I can't even compare to such a great racer!</i>

26
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,714
<i>Pm going to lose!</i>

27
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:29,048
"Act 26: The New Downhill Legend!"
I'm going <i>to</i> lose!

28
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:33,588
"Act 26: The New Downhill Legend!"

29
00:03:14,594 --> 00:03:16,429
<i>Amazing!</i>

30
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:18,264
<i>Pm getting goose bumps.</i>

31
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:21,264
<i>He': following such a perfect line.</i>

32
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,267
<i>If! weren't right behind him,
copying his every move,</i>

33
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:30,872
<i>it would have been almost
impossible for me to do this.</i>

34
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,285
<i>Beginners can drive fast on a straight line.</i>

35
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,421
<i>Intermediate drivers can master corners.</i>

36
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:45,422
<i>But truly advanced drivers
find their own course,</i>

37
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:47,858
<i>and that': how they get ahead.</i>

38
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,701
<i>To find that ultimate course</i>

39
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,702
<i>is the main objective of
my "fastest driver" theory.</i>

40
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,005
<i>I can'! believe I've found
the best example of my theory</i>

41
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:05,048
<i>on such an occasion, after
searching for it for so long.</i>

42
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,261
<i>What amazing talent.</i>

43
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,203
--Here they come!
--Which one is it'!

44
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:34,014
Ryosuke Takahashi or the Eight-Six?!

45
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,754
Whoa!What intensity!

46
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,034
How impressive!

47
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,281
<i>It': no good! I can'! widen the lead!</i>

48
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,339
All right! They're coming!

49
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,340
Just the sound of it gives me shivers!

50
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,510
Since the straight section before
the five hairpins is quite long,

51
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,241
I bet there'll be some hard braking.

52
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:25,123
Here they come! The Eight-Six is in front!

53
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,124
<i>RYOsukQQ!</i>

54
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,364
Entrance to the five hairpins here.

55
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,365
I can see both cars now.
The Eight-Six is leading!

56
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:37,788
Wow, the Eight-Six?!

57
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,001
<i>Too much speed. He messed it up.</i>

58
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:00,558
<i>Damn it! Tum!</i>

59
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:12,338
<i>He could have powered through it</i>

60
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:15,338
<i>and brought it back if he were
driving a more powerful car.</i>

61
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,576
<i>But how reckless to try it with an Eight-Six!</i>

62
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,848
Ryosuke': FC took the lead!

63
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:24,684
What?!

64
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,285
When the Eight-Six over-accelerated

65
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:30,286
and under-steered, Ryosuke passed it!

66
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,311
<i>The Eight-Six under-steered?</i>

67
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,963
He's just amazing!
Ryosuke is in a class by himself!

68
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,080
Now I am totally sure that
Ryosuke is going to win!

69
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,354
<i>Such a strange guy...</i>

70
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,890
<i>What an unexpected weakness!</i>

71
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,959
<i>I was planning to stay
behind him a little longer</i>

72
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,127
<i>so I could hide my strengths.</i>

73
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,128
<i>Now that Pm in from,I don'!
want him to get right behind me,</i>

74
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,565
<i>so before he recovers, I'd better widen the gap</i>

75
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:18,068
<i>and guarantee myself the win.</i>

76
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,426
The FC just passed us.

77
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,661
The Eight-Six is a little behind.

78
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,930
Ryosuke': time is amazing!

79
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,931
He could beat the course record
by almost twelve seconds!

80
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,570
<i>Twelve seconds?!</i>

81
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,872
<i>The race is over.</i>

82
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,213
<i>My brother will just widen the gap now.</i>

83
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,046
Just hearing about it gives me chills.

84
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,217
Even if he loses, it won't
hurt Takumi': reputation.

85
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,288
It's just that Ryosuke Takahashi
is simply incomparable!

86
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:12,958
Wait a minute.The race isn't over yet!

87
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,959
I still believe that Takumi
can come back and win.

88
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,130
<i>But...</i>

89
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,799
He always has, hasn't he?!

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,800
No matter how bad it's looked,
he's always come back and won.

91
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,117
I am sure he can do it again!

92
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,213
<i>Please get to the bottom safely!</i>

93
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,860
<i>Don'! do anything crazy, Takumi!</i>

94
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:00,803
<i>The merit of a light and compact
rotary engine is not the power,</i>

95
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:06,175
<i>but the agility you get from an
ideal front-back weight distribution.</i>

96
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:11,748
<i>I just love the consistent
spirit of the rotary engine.</i>

97
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,923
<i>Even if! have to put my pride on the line,</i>

98
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,524
<i>the rotary engine can'! fall behind
the Eight-Six on the comers!</i>

99
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,500
Whoa!

100
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:48,017
Aren't Ryosuke Takahashi and Takumi great'!

101
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:51,554
The drift punks around here don't
even come close to that speed.

102
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:55,525
Sayuki, what's going to happen in this race'!

103
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,395
It's impossible to pass
Ryosuke once he's in front.

104
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,400
But it's Takumi he's racing against!

105
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,340
Takumi hasn't given up yet.

106
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,341
The lines he chooses are better than the FC's.

107
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,491
You can tell he's driven Akina Pass a lot.

108
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:30,593
<i>I thought he would be way
ahead once he passed me!</i>

109
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,366
<i>I still have a chance!</i>

110
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,777
<i>Pm getting closer!</i>

111
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,918
<i>The gap is narrowing!</i>

112
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,186
Shoot!

113
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,186
<i>All of a sudden, my from tires
aren't sticking to the road.</i>

114
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,691
<i>Could it be heat wear?</i>

115
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,365
<i>Following and copying the Eight-Six': driving</i>

116
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:10,146
<i>might have put more strain on
the front tires than I expected.</i>

117
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,910
<i>The Eight-Six is getting closer...</i>

118
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,131
<i>Isn't he having any problems with his tires?</i>

119
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:30,472
<i>A little wear on the tires won't
affect my technique, though.</i>

120
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:55,414
<i>I can'! catch him like this.
I need to get closer all at once!</i>

121
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,364
<i>Dam it! is this my limit?</i>

122
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,365
<i>Should I try that thing?</i>

123
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,735
<i>The "other gutter driving" that
my dad talked about that time?</i>

124
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
Oh, good job.

125
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,453
Hey, Dad. I think I found a good trick

126
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,324
to avoid skidding on a
curve in snowy weather.

127
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,326
You hook the tires on one side
into the gutter next to the road.

128
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,972
You can corner so easily, it's like a joke.

129
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,502
"Gutter driving," huh'!

130
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,204
I use that technique often, too.

131
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,473
Shoot.You use it too, huh?

132
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,474
Takumi. There are two ways to
use the gutters in Akina': roads.

133
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:02,712
The method you discovered is to
use the gutter as you enter the corner

134
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:06,005
so you can prevent under-steering.

135
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,419
There's another one.This one
emphasizes recovery after a corner.

136
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,824
The timing for getting both in
and out of the gutter is different.

137
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:19,207
It's pretty tough. Try and
figure it out for yourself.

138
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,004
<i>I haven'! tried it yet.</i>

139
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,525
<i>It': a big gamble. Should I try it?</i>

140
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,734
<i>Okay. Here I go!</i>

141
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,845
What did he just do?!

142
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:10,236
<i>What the heck did he just do?!</i>

143
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,821
It sounds like they're coming, Shingo.

144
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,558
Judging from the skidding sound,

145
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,559
they must be very close to each other.

146
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,497
Just as I expected!

147
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,498
This is the only spot where
they can go for the win.

148
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,436
The straightaway lets you
speed up for the braking to come.

149
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,075
Unlike the rest of the
narrow mountain pass road,

150
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:39,075
this corner has three lanes,
so you can choose your own line.

151
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,411
On top of that, this is a compound
corner where two R's overlap.

152
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,318
The finish line is right over there.

153
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,653
This has to be the point
where they go for the win.

154
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:52,554
The one who leads after this corner
is the one who wins the race!

155
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:57,427
Here they come!

156
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,165
Wow! The FC is in front!

157
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,601
The Eight-Six is right behind him!

158
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,137
What will they do?!

159
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,473
There's no way to pass from the outside!

160
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:09,842
Go inside!

161
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,012
Inside?! Or outside?!

162
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,119
Outside?!

163
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,120
<i>Ryosuke didn't leave any room on the inside!</i>

164
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,343
<i>There was no way to go inside!</i>

165
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,345
Whoa! The FC is in front!

166
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,346
The inside has the absolute advantage!

167
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,718
The FC is skidding to the outside
of the curve! Is this for real?!

168
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,408
He's going way too fast
to get out of the curve!

169
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,201
No way!

170
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:14,738
Their lines will cross!

171
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,377
Here they come!

172
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,378
Here they are!

173
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,151
No way!

174
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,152
I can't believe Ryosuke Takahashi is losing!

175
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,155
That's Ta ku m I's ca r!

176
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,468
<i>Takumi...</i>

177
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,310
It's the Eight-Six! The Eight-Six won!

178
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,080
I can't believe it! On top of that,

179
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:31,271
he set an amazing course record!

180
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,987
<i>My big brother has lost.</i>

181
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,407
<i>The legend of the unbeatable man is over.</i>

182
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,537
Banzai! Takumi won! The Eight-Six won!

183
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,952
Hooray!

184
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,447
Whoopee! He did it!

185
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:09,207
Banzai! Banzai!

186
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,994
Hey! Are you listening, Bunta?!

187
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:19,397
Takumi has won!

188
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,398
Don't get so excited. Of course
he won. That's no surprise.

189
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,136
He set an amazing course record, too!

190
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,207
Right, right. Okay, then. I'm hanging up.

191
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,641
That guy!

192
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,352
So he won...

193
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,353
That Takumi...

194
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,858
We've just seen one heck of a race.

195
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,894
I'm still in a state of shock.

196
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:50,894
Wow,

197
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,732
Hey, Shingo! Get farther away from me!

198
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:57,733
If someone sees us, they'll think we're friends.

199
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:00,237
You get away!

200
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:06,175
Takumi did it! He beat RyosukeTakahashi.

201
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,545
--That is so cool!
--Yeah.

202
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,517
Maybe I'll askTakumi out again!

203
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:13,685
What'!

204
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:16,020
<i>Why don't you ask that guy out too, Make'!</i>

205
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,289
What was his name'!

206
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,225
<i>Let's see...</i>

207
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,060
--lketani'!
--Right!That's him!

208
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,991
There's still a chance!
Let's go on a double date!

209
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:46,048
Um, there's one thing I want to ask...

210
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,459
Do you mind'!

211
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:54,156
How come you waited for me
to take charge in the race'!

212
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,594
You think I slowed down on purpose

213
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:01,830
in the last half of the race'! No way.

214
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,637
But then why...'!

215
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,339
You must have picked up your pace a notch.

216
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,340
I tried my best not to slow down,

217
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,978
but my front tires were acting strange.

218
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,979
--Tires'!
--But I can't use tires as an excuse...

219
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,449
Conditions were the same for
both of us, and I clearly lost.

220
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,503
<i>I, uh...</i>

221
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:28,657
I don't think that I'm a faster
driver, or anything like that.

222
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,831
You really are weird.

223
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,033
I've never met anyone like you before.

224
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:39,034
Don't be content with winning
on a small stage like Akina.

225
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,175
Turn your gaze towards
the bigger world out there.

226
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,943
Takumi Fujiwara... you were very fast.

227
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,348
See you around.

228
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:23,846
<i>I open a window to the dawn sky</i>

229
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,685
<i>And your bare skin almost
liquid in the soft breeze</i>

230
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,393
<i>Gently I draw you to me, and with each kiss</i>

231
00:21:39,364 --> 00:21:40,698
Gently <i>I</i> draw you <i>to</i> me, and with <i>each</i>
kiss --It's autumn already. --Yeah.

232
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:42,434
<i>My heart trembfes like I can hardly
believe --It's autumn already. --Yeah.</i>

233
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:45,369
<i>My heart tremble: like I can hardly believe
Shank! we head back, Takuml?!</i>

234
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,938
<i>My heart tremble: like I can hardly believe
Sure.</i>

235
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,372
<i>My heart tremble: like I can hardly believe</i>

236
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:51,373
<i>The passionate thrill brimming over within</i>

237
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:54,779

This car is small but very fast.

239
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,415
Knocks on a rusty door
I think it's really cool. I like it after all.

240
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,086
<i>Knocks on a rusty door</i>
