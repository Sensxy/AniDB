After he got into racing,

67
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,364
I'd always go with him to his races.

68
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,535
There was a time when I was using

69

most of my salary to maintain his car.

70

There was nothing I wanted to do.

72
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,477
It was easy to just follow
my car-crazed brother.

73
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,983
But that's no good.

74
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,852
He and I are two different people.

75
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,853
I need to find out what I want to do.

76
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,724
Yeah.

77
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,997
Unfortunately...

78
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,998
...there's nothing I'm
passionate about right now.

79

anyone to talk to like this.

I remembered the
Fujiwara Tofu Shop emblem...

167
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,680
<i>...on</i> yOUl' car.

168
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,681
I'll be coming to Gunma
tomorrow to get my sister.

169
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:29,552
I heard she took off from work yesterday

170
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:32,424
and didn't come back until this morning.

171
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,592
So irresponsible!

172
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,593
I can't stand irresponsible people,
even when it's my sister.

173
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,932
<i>Itsuki is in trouble.</i>

174
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,933
But that's my problem. Let's talk business.

175
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,438
I want to race you.

176
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:49,439
Leave tomorrow night open.

177
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,076
Make sure your engine is
fully operational by then,

178
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,980
or it'll be pointless.

179
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,615
I trust you.

180
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,546
I'll be in touch.

181
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,065
Hey,Takumi.

182
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,101
What's up?

183
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,292
I have a favor to ask.

184
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:23,172
I may be racing the
Eight-Six Turbo tomorrow night,

185
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:27,176
so I want to make this engine usable by then.

186
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:31,514
I need your help installing a tachometer.

187
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,918
A tachometer?

188
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,187
You know car stuff.

189
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:39,188
I have no clue, so I need help.

190
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,227
Please show me how!

191
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,688
Okay.

192
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,897
I don't know the specifics,

193
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,900
but I can tell that this engine
isn'tjust another engine.

194
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:54,737
--Yeah.
--It has a good carburetor

195
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,276
and a wildly twisted header.

196
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,645
It's a new five-valve engine,

197
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,646
and it's really tuned-up.

198
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,650
It sure is hard to believe that this engine

199
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,921
has less power than the old one.

200
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,556
This Wataru guy

201
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,557
said that I would get
more power at a higher rpm.

202
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,261
I want to believe what he said.

203
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,331
Unlocking a sealed high-rev zone...

204
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,935
If that's true, it's exciting.

205
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:29,505
It's not that hard to install a tachometer,

206
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,843
but there's one thing I'm not so sure about.

207
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:37,413
Are you sure you want to
change the current setup

208
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,483
without asking your dad first'!

209
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:45,788
My dad wasn't home tonight.

210
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,360
And he wouldn't say yes

211
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,863
if I asked him face to face.

212
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,766
So, I've decided to do it myself.

213
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,767
I want to be able to use the
engine to its full potential

214
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,771
by tomorrow night.

215
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,139
Okay.

216
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,140
In that case, I'll help you.

217
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,810
I'll buy a tachometer
first thing in the morning.

218
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,048
After school,

219
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,049
bring the car here as fast as you can.

220
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,154
Thank you so much, lketani!

221
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:18,223
You're a huge help.

222
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,058
You and your Eight-Six

223
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:23,059
have saved my butt many times,

224
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,812
so this is the least I can do.

225
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,902
What?! It'll take a week'!

226
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,833
I need it today.

227
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,875
This is bad! No one has it in stock.

228
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,376
I guess very few cars

229
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,377
use 10,000 rpm tachometers.

230
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,181
What am I going to tellTakumi?

231
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,352
I guess no one carries it.

232
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,353
Boss, do you know anyone?

233
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:53,612
Well, maybe I do.

234
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,462
Hello'!

235
00:14:57,463 --> 00:15:00,463
Hey,Yuichi.

236
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,734
Yeah, I have one.

237
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,735
What?! Are you sure you have one, Masashi'!

238
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,038
Bunta asked me to get one for his Eight-Six.

239
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,642
A racing tachometer, and water
temperature and oil pressure gauges.

240
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:14,646
Hold on.

241
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,915
This is a surprise, lketani!

242
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,250
I've got goose bumps!

243
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,251
This is what Bunta meant by "sealing it."

244
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,655
Hey, Masashi! Bring those
gauges over here right now!

245
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,333
Hey,Takumi!

246
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,674
What's your hurry'!

247
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,952
<i>M°gi!</i>

248
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,370
Hi, Takumi...

249
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,021
Sorry, but I'm busy right now.

250
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:59,452
But,Takumi!

251
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,058
<i>Takumi...</i>

252
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,428
Magi...

253
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,038
Okay, now you just have to screw it down.

254
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,975
That's it.

255
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,647
Now it's done.

256
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,983
Wasn't that easy'!

257
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,318
Thanks to you guys.

258
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:30,319
I wouldn't have known how to do it alone.

259
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,990
Installing the tachometer isn't the end of it.

260
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,662
Just because it's a high-rev engine

261
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,164
doesn't mean that it'll rev infinitely.

262
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:43,165
Without knowing its top rpm,

263
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,537
you can't have a full-blast race.

264
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,673
I'm sure your dad knows.

265
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,508
If you don't know its limit,

266
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,509
you may end up damaging this engine.

267
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,670
My dad.

268
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,469
Isn't that...'!

269
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,634
It looks like you're ready.

270
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,635
We'll race tonight as planned.

271
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,972
I'll let you pick the course for our race.

272
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,709
Haven't we seen that Eight-Six Turbo before?

273
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,812
Yeah, and he's ltsuki': girlfriend's brother.

274
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,482
What?! That sounds very complicated.

275
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,485
Okay, that's fine.

276
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:38,656
I'll see you there.

277
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,027
Later.

278
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,835
Takumi, where are you two racing?

279
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,839
We'll come root for you.

280
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,540
"Matsuya Inn"
We'll come root for you.

281
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:57,531
"Matsuya Inn"

282
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,244
Big brother!

283
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,214
This is serious.

284
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,215
I told you not to make our aunt look bad.

285
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:09,785
You made Mom and Dad worry.

286
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,888
Get your stuff together tonight.
I'm taking you home.

287
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,793
That's my decision to make!

288
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,796
It was wrong to stay out till morning
without letting anyone know.

289
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,501
But I did nothing I'm ashamed of,

290
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,306
so I shouldn't have to go home!

291
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,808
Why don't you explain that

292
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,644
to Mom and Dad instead of me'!

293
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,646
If you like it here,

294
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,647
you can tell them so and come back.

295
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,518
I can tell you've changed a little,

296
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,856
and I have to admit

297
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,857
that you've even matured a little.

298
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:51,227
But they don't know that, so they worry.

299
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:54,603
They'll feel better if they hear it from you.

300
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:59,370
Okay, I'll go.

301
00:18:59,371 --> 00:18:59,604
"Takeuchi"
Okay, I'll go.

302
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,805
<i>“Take u chi“</i>

303
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,373
"Takeuchi"
What's going on'!

304
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:02,507
What's going on'!

305
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,309
I'm racing tonight.

306
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,012
What?! With who'!

307
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:11,013
Not with Kazumi': brother?

308
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,216
Yeah, and I have a favor to ask.

309
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:18,687
I'm a little scared, so can you come with me'!

310
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,559
Yeah, of course.

311
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,490
Thanks. I'll pick you up later.

312
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,557
What is it'!

313
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,558
I'm racing in this car tonight.

314
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:58,863
It has a new tachometer.

315
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,474
Please tell me what the top rpm is.

316
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,551
Please.

317
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,000
Make sure to rev up to 11,000 rpm.

318
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,200
Don't lose.

319
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,758
Thanks, Dad.

320
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,740
Takumi, why are we taking the highway?

321
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,644
He told me to pick any course I wanted.

322
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,149
So, where did you pick'!

323
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,151
Shomaru Pass.

324
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,902
What?! That's his turf!

325
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,378
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

326

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,850
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

331
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,719
<i>The warm wind</i>

332
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,859
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

333
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,534
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

334
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,542
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

335
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,782
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

336
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:48,390
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

337
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,380
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

338
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,751
<i>Takumi': new engine vs. Wataru': turbo engine!</i>

339
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,486
<i>The climax!</i>

340
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,755
<i>Next on initial D: Second Stage...</i>

341
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,756
<i>"Eight-Six vs. Eight-Six: A Spirited Race."</i>

342
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:15,279
<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
