<i>And go straight to our reason for living</i>

--I'm starving. Let's get some pizza!
--Count me in!

For real'! With Natsuki Mogi'!

32
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:49,906
Now that is one fine babe.
Everyone wants a piece of that booty!

33
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,411
Yeah, well, she'll do whatever I tell her to.

34
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,449
It's time I broke her in.

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,951
What do you mean, "break her in"?

36
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,553
You know what he means!

37

Girls are all the same.

38
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,592
They act like they don't want it at first,
but then they come around.

39
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,813
The other day I called her up to the roof, and...

Just who do you think you are?!

44
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,773
The little squirt doesn't know his place!

45
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,142
Cut it out,Takumi!

46
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,611
I've had enough of listening to you bastards!

47
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,612
Why, you little...!

48
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:32,223

<i>When a person has a cute girl with him,</i>

52

<i>I have someone I can'! help thinking of a little.</i>

55
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:41,117
lketani! Hey! Where'd lketani go'!

56
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,656
Iketani'!

57
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,657
Oh, you mean lketani, whose terrifying
screams echoed across Mt. Akina

58
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:52,662
as he rocketed down the dangerous
three-corner road and passed out!

59
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,434
That lketani just left on a delivery.
He took the pickup truck.

60
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,304
Oh... If lketani': not here,
then maybe you can help, Takumi.

61
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,077
Could you deliver some papers
to the Yamada shop for me'!

62
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,779
You can take my car.

63
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,779
Uh, sure.

64
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,518
Hey, boss. Um...

65
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,255
You know, I have a license, too.

66
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,256
Why do you always ask lketani
and Takumi to run errands?

67
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:25,007
Well, you see... put your hand on
your chest and tell me what you feel.

68
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,102
--Now do you understand?
--No...

69
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,103
Simply put, I can trust
lketani and Takumi to drive.

70
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,473
As for you, though...

71
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,814
...you'd bring my car back with a
dent the size of your caved-in chest.

72
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,614
Well, there you have it.

73
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,950
<i>You just wait and see.</i>

74
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,761
<i>Once I get my own Eight-Six,
I'm gonna be the fastest racer around...</i>

75
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,959
<i>Whoa, an R32!</i>

76
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,061
Welcome, sir!

77
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,342
<i>What a ride! The R32': the bomb!</i>

78
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:04,769
<i>N-Night Kids!</i>

79
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:09,939
Hey, kid. My name's Nakazato.

80
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,277
Someone back on my turf
told me I could contact

81
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,217
a member of the Speed Stars at this station.

82
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Tell me this.When can I find
that Eight-Six at Akina?

83
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,695
Do you understand what I'm saying?

84
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,431
Aren't you a member of the Speed Stars'!

85
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:35,432
<i>Me... a member of the Speed Stars... Cool...</i>

86
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,739
I guess I came to the wrong place.

87
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,740
Wait! No, you're at the right place!

88
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,977
Actually, that Eight-Six guy and me,
we're down like brothers.

89
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,549
What?!

90
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,417
Yeah, people call us the Eight-Six Duo.

91
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,418
We're the fastest down-hillers on our team.

92
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,390
Really?

93
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,390
Yeah, well... actually, he may be
a bit faster than me, but still...

94
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:06,062
I didn't know anyone on the
Speed Stars could race at that level...

95
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,734
Yeah, um...Well, never mind that.

96
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:11,735
Say, I can deliver him a message if you want.

97
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,965
After all, he's my bro.

98
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,712
All right.Tell him this.

99
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,382
10 o'clock this Saturday night.

100
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,951
10 o'clock this Saturday night...'!

101
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,952
Nakazato of the Night Kids will be
waiting for him on top of Mt. Akina.

102
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,792
Waiting on top of Mt. Akina... What?!

103
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:36,027
It'll be a race to the bottom!

104
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,462
Wait! That's a... Hey!

105
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,898
Uh, you know...Wait a second, please!

106
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,200
Hey, wai...

107
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:45,201
<i>Oh, now I've really done it!</i>

108
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,238
<i>Did he just challenge Takumi?</i>

109
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:52,982
Oh, no! What am I going to tell Takumi?!

110
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,616
Takumi!

111
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,617
What are you all panicked about?

112
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,422
Never mind that.

113
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,423
Say, if you're free this Saturday,
you want to go racing at Mt. Akina'!

114
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,329
--No.
--Why not'!

115
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,330
Sorry, but I don't drive a car
unless it's absolutely necessary.

116
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,237
Takumi!

117
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:21,237
Thanks a lot. Come on in and have some coffee.

118
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,575
Okay.

119
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,044
Hey!

120
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,045
Not good.This is not good.

121
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,284
See you tomorrow.

122
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:35,053
Hey,Takumi.

123
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,922
Let me ask you something.

124
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,923
Suppose-just suppose» a racer
were to challenge you to a race.

125
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,762
You'd accept, of course, right'!

126
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,533
No way. I'm not into that scene.

127
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,602
What?! Don't say that!

128
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:52,271
What's it matter to you'!

129
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,271
<i>Um... well... uh...That's beside the point.</i>

130
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,244
You know, if a racer receives a challenge,

131
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,913
he has to stand up and accept it!

132
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:04,914
Well, that may be true for a racer.

133
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,986
But I'm no racer.

134
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,388
No racer'!

135
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:14,248
Besides, being forced to accept
challenges just isn't my thing.

136
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,730
<i>Not good. This is definitely not good...</i>

137
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,868
What'll I do'!

138
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,454
Only two more <i>days</i> to go.

139
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,455
<i>Eight-Six, Ryosuke Takahashi,
your days are numbered.</i>

140
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,622
<i>H! show you who': number one!</i>

141
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,404
lketani!

142
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:02,405
You accepted a challenge from
the Night Kids of Mt. Myogi?!

143
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,209
Why were you keeping something
that big a secret from us?!

144
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,215
I don't know what you're talking about.

145
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,017
It's no use trying to deny it.

146
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:14,586
The word's out all over town.

147
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,587
Eight-Six and R32 going at it on the downhill!

148
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,823
Eight-Six'! That's news to me!

149
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,227
What?! The word is, Nakazato came
to this gas station in person

150
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,900
to issue the challenge!

151
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,570
Takumi. Have you heard anything about this'!

152
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,371
No, not a word.

153
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,372
No one knows about this'! What's going on'!

154
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,079
S-Sorry!

155
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:44,047
Itsuki... you didn't...

156
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,027
<i>I...</i> I <i>accepted the challenge!</i>

157
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,557
Please forgive me!

158
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:55,558
Yesterday, Nakazato of the
Night Kids really came here.

159
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,696
He came by when lketani
and Takumi were out. <i>I...</i>

160
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,369
I couldn't help but pretend to be
a member of the Speed Stars...

161
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,771
...and before I knew what was happening...

162
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,641
...he had already issued
the challenge and driven off.

163
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,642
Why didn't you tell us about this before?!

164
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,546
I was going to tell you, I swear.
I was just waiting for the right moment.

165
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,150
Takumi, I'm sorry. I messed up.

166
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,389
Please forgive me!

167
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,591
It's a bit late now...

168
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:30,752
Forgive me... Please forgive me...

169
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,071
Looks like the R32': out again tonight.

170
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,072
He's racing against the
Eight-Six tomorrow night, right'!

171
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,411
I'm definitely going to watch that!

172
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:49,147
If Nakazato of the Night Kids
is challenging the Eight-Six

173
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,483
that beat Keisuke Takahashi,

174
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,119
there's no way we can miss that!

175
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,088
On the surface it may seem like a race

176
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,490
between the Speed Stars and the Night Kids,

177
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,192
but it's really a battle
between Nakazato': pride

178
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,895
and the pride of the Red Suns'
Takahashi Brothers!

179
00:11:03,896 --> 00:11:05,964
No matter how the race turns out,

180
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,800
Ryosuke Takahashi': not going
to just sit back and watch.

181
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:12,461
The summer nights are
starting to heat up already!

182
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,251
Oh, man...

183
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,380
What are we going to do'!

184
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,616
Everyone around town's
talking about this race.

185
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,885
It's too late to back out now.

186
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,886
Maybe I'd better askTakumi to race.

187
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,423
Even Takumi might not have
what it takes to go against the R32.

188
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,461
That Night Kid Nakazato is as famous
a racer as the Takahashi Brothers...

189
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:44,333
It'd be a tough battle. It might
even be over from the get-go.

190
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:51,586
On second thought, maybe I
shouldn't ask him after all.

191
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,098
There you go.

192
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,767
Hey... Dad.

193
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,402
Is an R32 any good'!

194
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,403
<i>R32'! Yeah... That's</i> a <i>fast car...</i>

195
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,409
Could you win'! In a downhill...

196
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,378
...against the R32'!

197
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:32,009
Yeah. I'd win against any
car I raced, R32 or not.

198
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,288
Do you think... I can win'!

199
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,324
I don't know...

200
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,325
It'd be a close race.

201
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,764
Why are you asking?

202
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,966
You gonna race an R32'!

203
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,001
No...

204
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,001
I'm... I'm just asking...

205
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,805
See ya.

206
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:58,207
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

207
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,584
<i>Now it's against an</i> R32...

208
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:09,835
<i>I'd better adjust the Eight-Sits settings...</i>

209
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,569
<i>It'd be a close race.</i>

210
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,902
I thought I'd find you if I
came here around this time.

211
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,639
It was about this time the night I first met you.

212
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:07,343
So you're going against Nakazato
from the Night Kids, huh'!

213
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:10,847
You're the talk of the town.

214
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:14,584
For your information, I don't
recall accepting that challenge.

215
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,256
What?!

216
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:20,256
He came to challenge me while I was away.

217
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,594
I don't intend to race him.

218
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,645
What do you mean you
don't intend to race him'!

219
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,899
Night Kid Nakazato issued a
personal challenge to you, right'!

220
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,571
Why don't you just accept it'!

221
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,572
Show him who's the fastest! You can beat him!

222
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,043
Why does it matter to you'!
This is between him and me.

223
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,415
No, it's not just between you two!

224
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:47,416
It's because you beat me!

225
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,320
If you lose to anyone, it's gotta
be to the Takahashi Brothers!

226
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,994
Until one of us beats you,
you can't lose to anyone else!

227
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,563
Not even to the R32!

228
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,564
I said I wasn't going to race him!
I have no reason to.

229
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,568
Reason? Does any racer need a reason to race'!

230
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Who ever said I was a racer'!

231
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,443
I'm in no mood forjokes!
Are you being sarcastic?!

232
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:18,783
In order for your technique
to be as good as it is,

233
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,085
you must have practiced for years!

234
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,086
Why would someone drive
like a racer if he's not a racer?!

235
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,025
I don't drive like I do because I like it.

236
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:30,026
I have to in order to help out at home.

237
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,430
Stop denying it.

238
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,431
No one can get as good
as you if they hate driving.

239
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:38,801
That's not it...You wouldn't understand.

240
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,440
You're the one who doesn't understand!

241
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,441
Could someone who hates
racing ever master drifting?

242
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,412
Only a person who loves the sport
could master something like that!

243
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,416
Maybe you don't realize it, but you're a racer.

244
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,419
Deep down you love driving! You hear me?!

245
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,790
If you love driving, then that
makes you racer enough!

246
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:05,027
And if you're a racer, then you should
be proud of your driving skills!

247
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,899
Accepting challenges is a racer': pride!

248
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,853
You make me sick.

249
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,425
<i>Do I really like driving...</i>

250
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:39,275
<i>...but just don'! realize it?</i>

251
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,602
<i>Still...</i>

252
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,602
<i>...being forced to accept every
challenge that comes along...</i>

253
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,327
<i>That isn't for me!</i>

254
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,412
Hey! ltsuki! Where's Takumi'!

255
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,281
He's on the late shift today.

256
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,449
<i>Oh...</i>

257
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,319
lketani...

258
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,320
I'm going to go to Mt. Akina
tonight to apologize to Nakazato.

259
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,593
<i>Hsuki...</i>

260
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,562
I'll get down on my knees if I
have to and tell him the truth.

261
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,164
Maybe he'll understand.

262
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,165
Besides, the Speed Stars had
nothing to do with this...

263
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,503
You don't think we can
convince Takumi to race'!

264
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,040
No. I know him better than anyone,
and he'll never do it...

265
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:28,411
He hates being forced into things

266
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,083
or having to follow others' orders.

267
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:34,252
He looks real mellow,

268
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,253
but once he says something,
there's no changing his mind...

269
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,623
<i>Stubborn... just like his father.</i>

270
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,361
He doesn't understand why
racers have to accept challenges.

271
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:49,365
The whole system offends him.

272
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,468
When someone tries to force
him to do something, he snaps.

273
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,772
One time in eleventh grade, he flipped out

274
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:57,575
and beat up a group of
seniors after soccer practice.

275
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,916
What?! Takumi did that'!

276
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,692
Boss, I finished cleaning up outside.

277
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:19,263
Thanks.

278
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,666
No problem. See you tomorrow, then.

279
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,201
Takumi!

280
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,503
Come and have a seat.

281
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,504
<i>Okay...</i>

282
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,174
You know, I overheard some talk.

283
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,613
You're going to race an R32 tonight?

284
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,215
What'! I'm...

285
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:40,216
Don't do it, Takumi.That guy's bad news.

286
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,787
<i>Uh... No,</i> I <i>wasn't...</i>

287
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,788
No, no. I know what you're going to say.

288
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,894
I've known everything from the beginning.

289
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,895
I know it wasn't your decision to take this race.

290
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,234
Itsuki was the one who screwed
up and accepted it, right'!

291
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,269
<i>Yeah...</i>

292
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,269
You know, you're too nice sometimes.

293
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,305
You gotta stop bailing your
friends out all the time.

294
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,909
Trust me. Whatever you do,
don't race that R32.

295
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,514
There's a lot you don't know about cars.

296
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,515
Do you even know what an R32 can do'!

297
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,452
Is an R32 that amazing?

298
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,826
<i>Gotcha! He took the bait...</i>

299
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:24,195
It's beyond amazing.

300
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,364
That car's in a class by itself!

301
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,233
Its driving system combines everything good

302
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,068
about FR and four-wheel drive.

303
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,069
It's a beast!

304
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,108
An Eight-Six or GT-R is no match for it.

305
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,377
If the driver was an amateur,
you'd have a chance,

306
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,246
but you're up against a famous racer, right'!

307
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,549
<i>Dad didn't tell me this.</i>

308
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,550
<i>He said it'd be a close race.</i>

309
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,187
Hey.

310
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,089
You with me'!

311
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,089
You just became famous yourself
by beating that team from Akagi.

312
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,529
You shouldn't ruin your name so fast...

313
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,530
It's not wise to go up against someone
you have no chance of defeating.

314
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:04,036
You hear me'!

315
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,237
Since your opponent's driving an R32,

316
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,318
no one would call you
a coward for backing out.

317
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:11,608
<i>A coward?!</i>

318
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:17,448
Boss...

319
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:20,449
Thanks for the warning...

320
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:26,556
...but I could careless
about my fame as a racer.

321
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:33,297
So you aren't going to back down'!

322
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,067
<i>No.</i>

323
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,436
Hearing about how amazing that car is

324
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:42,067
has only made me want to see it in action.

325
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,880
I'm not afraid of an R32 or any other car.

326
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:55,853
Whew!

327
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:59,424
He's exactly like his father...

328
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,895
"Temporarily Closed
Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

329
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,634
Temporarily closed'!

330
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,769
Dad never said anything about this.

331
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,770
How's he going to make
money if the shop's closed'!

332
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,924
Oh, no! The car!

333
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,614
If he went out drinking, I'm really in trouble.

334
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,615
He won't be back until morning!

335
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,454
I can't do anything without a car.

336
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,415
I should have asked to borrow it this morning!

337
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,895
Look at the crowd!

338
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:40,896
There's even more people out
tonight than at the Akagi race!

339
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Why did so many people come tonight?

340
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,972
You know they're not here to see the R32.

341
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,973
Yeah, they want to see that Eight-Six drift!

342
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,976
They say he barrels through
corners as if they're straightaways!

343
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,150
I can't wait to see this!

344
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,151
<i>Oh...</i> I <i>see...</i>

345
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,220
Uh, if he happens to show up,
could you ask him to call home'!

346
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,527
<i>Thanks...</i>

347
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:16,765
It's no use... I can't find <i>him...</i>

348
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,436
Damn!

349
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,917
Where the hell are you?!
Give me back my Eight-Six!

350
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,497
<i>My pride says you gotta be wild and tough</i>

351
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,566

<i>Never stop, I don't want to stop</i>

353
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:52,169
<i>Even if you cry because of a sacrificed love</i>

354
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,971
<i>Aim for the peak, sweep the winding street</i>

355
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:56,173
<i>Beep beep! The warning chime is so cheap!</i>

356
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:57,642
<i>The sheep should clear the road</i>

357
00:22:57,642 --> 00:23:00,077
<i>'Cuz Pm never gonna stop, streak my dream</i>

358
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:03,078
<i>Easy motivation is total stimulation</i>

359
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,949
<i>You tried to escape,
but anywhere is a safety zone</i>

360
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:11,019
<i>Something is within your grasp
and something is forgotten</i>

361
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:15,023
<i>Even if the world ends it will never change</i>

362
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,961
<i>Beasty shout, no one can touch you</i>

363
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:27,035
<i>Cross over now to the time of an intense dream</i>

364
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,410
<i>Rage your dream, split the darkness</i>

365
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,415
<i>Like a streak to the peak</i>

366
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,416
<i>Erase the freezing darkness worldwide</i>

367
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,555
<i>Rage your dream, and open the road</i>

368
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,094
<i>Di-ding down, another round never slow down</i>

369

<i>A point 01 second knockdown</i>

<i>Reverberations left behind,

the R32 or the Eight-Six?</i>

382
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:34,438
<i>Of course, I'd like to say the Eight-Six...</i>

383
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:37,439
<i>...but I don't know if even Takumi
can beat a GT-R, the fastest domestic.</i>

384
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,310
<i>The biggest question is if
Takumi will even come to race!</i>
