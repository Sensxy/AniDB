It was so easy I'm at a loss.

21
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:51,410
That Ian-Evo is monstrous.

Its extra boost and traction...

No FR can imitate that,

There's no denying the mechanical
superiority of a 4WD car.

26

This just became a tough race for Ryosuke.

Hey,Takumi'!

40
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,754

41
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,264
Maybe it's over.

I have no idea.

44
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,832
I can't tell, because I lost to that Ian-Evo

45
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,765
before I saw his full capabilities.

46
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,346
I'm getting upsetjust talking to you about it.

--Sorry.
--Don't be sorry.

48
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,361
I mean, talking to you is helping me get it out.

49
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,625
I was so depressed all day today.

50
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:55,031
After the engine blew up,

51
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:57,803
the Len-Eve's driver told me

52
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,405
that he didn't consider it a race.

53
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,574
He said we would race for real

54
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,177
when I had a better car.

55
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,378
He did?

56
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,547
The way he said it,

57
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:11,548
it sounded like he was reasoning
with me like a schoolteacher

58
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,573
instead of bragging about his victory.

59
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,857
My pride just won't let me forget what he said.

60

...let's get started.

64
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,441
By tomorrow night,
there will be a rumor in Akina

65
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,893
that the "Fujiwara Tofu"
car has been resurrected.

66
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,962
<i>It': a finely tuned car, Kyoichi.</i>

67
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,963
<i>It has surprisingly fine cornering abilities,</i>

68
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,563
<i>and it can accelerate at any rpm.</i>

69
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,204
<i>It turns easily and exits comers swiftly.</i>

70
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,861
<i>Its acceleration is unbeatable.</i>

71
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,316
<i>What a scary car!</i>

72
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,627
<i>It': overwhelming to observe it up close.</i>

73
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,824
<i>But it': not like I just realized this.</i>

74
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,347
<i>I found it out yesterday.</i>

75
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,104
Wow! Ryosuke bumped the guardrail!

76
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,841
He had to do that to keep up with that Evo Ill.

77
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,247
Look at this time.

78
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:51,616
Amazing! If the Evo Ill keeps this up,

79
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:54,617
he'll surpass the course record.

80
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,456
Ryosuke isn't slow.

81
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:00,457
That Evo Ill is going really fast.

82
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,895
Hello, this is corner #35.

83
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,665
The Evo Ill is still ahead.

84
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:07,899
Got it.

85
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,900
Keisuke, will he be okay'!

86
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:13,903
The Len-Eve's maintaining his pace.

87
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,540
He may just run away with the victory.

88
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,711
Don't worry.

89
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,647
My brother will overcome this predicament.

90
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:25,417
Sudo sure is fast.

91
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:28,418
Most of us here probably didn't
expect him to be this fast.

92
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,224
I certainly didn't. But my brother did.

93
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Using the data collected
at various checkpoints

94
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,664
during last night's race against the Eight-Six,

95
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,669
he was able to calculate Sudo': abilities

96
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,673
more precisely than I ever could.

97
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:51,510
Sol believe...

98
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,471
...that my brother will win in the end.

99
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,682
<i>The misfiring system and
the 4WD are a killer combo.</i>

100
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,621
<i>Full acceleration in low gears won'! cut it.</i>

101
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,671
<i>But I may get a chance at a high-speed comer.</i>

102
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,005
<i>I knew it!</i>

103
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,639
<i>He isn't attacking from another angle.</i>

104
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,410
<i>Why not?</i>

105
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,046
<i>His passiveness is eerie.</i>

106
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,415
<i>Has he given up?</i>

107
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:33,416
<i>No,I know very well that he isn't like that.</i>

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,470
<i>He will attack.</i>

109
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,230
<i>I know Pm in the superior position,</i>

110
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,268
<i>but I feel like he': hunting me down.</i>

111
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,269
<i>Have I not yet overcome
my complex about Ryosuke?</i>

112
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,908
<i>A victory over him will erase that.</i>

113
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,179
<i>Pm ready for you, Ryosuke.</i>

114
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,640
<i>All my tires still have full traction.</i>

115
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,821
<i>What a thrilling race this is!</i>

116
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:14,392
<i>I only have one chance.</i>

117
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,328
<i>I need to attack precisely...</i>

118
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,329
<i>...into the flickering loophole.</i>

119
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,234
Ryosuke is right on him.

120
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,903
But the Evo Ill is going fast.

121
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:27,904
He isn't slowing his pace at all!

122
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,341
It doesn't look good for Ryosuke Takahashi.

123
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,477
The finish line is right after this corner.

124
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,850
His defeat has become more certain now.

125
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,486
There!

126
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,567
The Evo Ill is still ahead!

127
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,311
<i>This right tum is my chance!</i>

128
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,336
<i>Kyoichi, your weakness lies</i>

129
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,337
<i>in your unconquered fear of turning right.</i>

130
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,960
<i>Frankly...</i>

131
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:09,032
<i>...you stink at turning right!</i>

132
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,321
<i>What?!</i>

133
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:18,955
--The FC took the outside!
--Amazing!

134
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,538
The Evo Ill is completely blocked by the FC!

135
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,465
<i>Dam! I can'! utilize the 4WD': traction</i>

136
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,836
<i>or the misfiring system in this situation!</i>

137
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,543
Incredible! The FC is cornering
while blocking the Evo Ill!

138
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,748
Go, Ryosuke Takahashi!

139
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,089
Go! Go! Go!

140
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,596
--Go, Ryosuke!
--He's going!

141
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,373
--He's ahead!
--They switched!

142
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,415
That's it, Ryosuke!

143
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,136
Keep it up! Keep going!

144
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,059
He did it!

145
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,060
A course record! A super win!

146
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,865
Eat our dust!

147
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,586
The Red Suns save Gunma!

148
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,618
--Yeah!
--He did it!

149
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,452
I can't believe Kyoichi couldn't beat him.

150
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,791
An amazing course record.

151
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,792
I've never seen Ryosuke go that fast.

152
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:06,498
Why is he faster in battles than usual'!

153
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,499
My brother usually leaves
enough of a safety margin

154
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:13,002
to avoid crashing during our time trials.

155
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,675
When he's forced to raise the bar,

156
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,676
a record like this is the natural result.

157
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,845
That Evo Ill was a tough opponent.

158
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,517
So he got a bit serious.

159
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,298
Wow,

160
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,390
What a win!

161
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:34,731
That corner was amazing!

162
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,064
I want to ask you something, Ryosuke.

163
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,735
What's the difference between us'!

164
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,573
Why can't I beat you'!

165
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:50,575
I just don't get it.

166
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,044
Please tell me.

167
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,045
In my opinion, your technique
is almost as good as mine.

168
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,883
No need for consolation. Just tell me why!

169
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:04,253
I'm saying that it's not
because of your technique.

170
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,327
Your weakness is your right turn.

171
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,596
Not all right turns...

172
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,932
...but at certain right turns,

173
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,601
your weakness surfaces.

174
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,103
Right turns'!

175
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:21,104
To the right of the center line is a "dead zone"

176
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:24,109
occupied by opposing traffic.

177
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,611
You can't attack a right-hand corner

178
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,280
without worrying about a head-on collision.

179
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,117
No one can give it 100%.

180
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:34,619
But with experience and effort,

181
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,340
you can come close to 100%.

182
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,125
Do you understand, Kyoichi'!
That's the difference.

183
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,728
In motorsports, you don't have
to worry about opposing traffic.

184
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,032
The Gymkhana circuit
doesn't have two-way traffic.

185
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,302
And your home course,
Nikko lrohazaka, is one-way,

186
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,145
so there's no opposing traffic.

187
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,913
In your counterattack,

188
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:04,914
you always stay outside at right-hand corners.

189
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,718
I read that as meaning
you're afraid of the inside.

190
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:11,854
In the race against the Eight-Six,
you showed me too much,

191
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:15,278
which is why you lost.

192
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,207
<i>You beat me, Ryosuke.</i>

193
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:32,578
<i>My belief that I had caught up
with you was an illusion.</i>

194
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,980
<i>You have street "charisma."</i>

195
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:42,120
It was amazing!

196
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,121
I realized again how great
Ryosuke Takahashi really is.

197
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:49,592
Anyway, the Ian-Evo squad
"storm" that threatened Gunma

198
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,931
has blown itself out,

199
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:55,133
and peace has been restored.

200
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,134
Yeah. I should've gone to watch the race.

201
00:13:58,137 --> 00:14:01,137
By the way, were Takumi and ltsuki with you'!

202
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,409
I didn't see them there.

203
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,878
Maybe Takumi didn't feel like it

204
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,380
after his loss the other night.

205
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,049
I'm sure he didn't.

206
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,050
Even we are still in shock.

207
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:17,086
He specifically told me
he wouldn't go to Akagi.

208
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,576
I wonder what changed his mind.

209
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,931
I'm so happy that Ryosuke Takahashi won!

210
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:34,268
Now it's official that
Gunma': standard is very high.

211
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,138
I'll see you in class!

212
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,727
Hey! You won't believe this,
Takumi.The other day...

213
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,850
Wait,Takumi!

214
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,464
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like talking to you.

215
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,709
"A few days later"

216
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:13,709
What'! My dad's Eight-Six'!

217
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,848
It must be a mistake.

218
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,549
I don't know anything about it.

219
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,550
One of our team members says
he saw it in Akina one night.

220
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:26,222
It was a three-door "panda" Trueno.

221
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,861
I don't think it was ours.

222
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,697
Where is your dad's car, anyway?

223
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:35,366
I don't really know.

224
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,535
We towed it from Akagi,

225
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,536
and my dad took it somewhere after that.

226
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,541
What about your morning deliveries?

227
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,542
I'm using a pickup truck my dad brought in.

228
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,881
Don't tell me that your legendary Eight-Six

229
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,882
is at a scrap yard right now.

230
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,119
I'll cry!

231
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,622
I doubt it.

232
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,623
My dad said he would put in another engine.

233
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,626
Seriously? What kind of engine?

234
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,862
I doubt it'll be another normal 4AG engine.

235
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:11,701
Maybe it'll be a turbo!

236
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,554
I have no interest in that, really.

237
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,409
Why is that'!

238
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,244
I think that, of all parts,

239
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,245
the engine is the most
important element of a car.

240
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:29,097
--| guess so.
--It's like the brain in a human body.

241
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,990
Hey, Takumi...

242
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,991
People usually compare it to the human heart.

243
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,995
Is that right'!

244
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,497
It's the heart, then.

245
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,498
I'd just hate to have another engine in it.

246
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,502
It would feel like a different car.

247
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,540
I guess I can see that.

248
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,876
You're attached to it.

249
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,877
I can understand how you feel...

250
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:56,914
...but we can't help wondering

251
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,485
what kind of engine it'll have.

252
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,042
How does it feel, Bunta'!

253
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,377
It's getting better,

254
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,378
but since the engine is so good,
the suspension can't catch up.

255
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:33,051
The engine is that good, huh'!

256
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,386
Yeah, I love it.

257
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,387
It sounds very tempting.

258
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,444
I may want to ride with you next time.

259
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:46,695
This car is very scary.

260
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:50,699
That's not for you to say, Bunta.

261
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,869
I already know how scary your driving can be.

262
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,742
Let me give you a glimpse.

263
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,143
What'!

264
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,182
Hey, Bunta!

265
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:05,683
How did that happen?!

266
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:08,684
You know, I needed to use this

267
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,689
as a wall to hold up my whole body.

268
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,690
I used to think the side G-force in pass racing

269
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,229
wasn't worthy of a bucket seat.

270
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,230
But I think my bones will bruise
if we don't put one in now.

271
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,138
I've had enough for today.

272
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:29,340
This is one tough customer.

273
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,243
But that makes it more exciting.

274
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,244
I still haven't decided
how I'm going to set it up.

275
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,748
I'll take my time and enjoy it.

276
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:43,252
I need to consider that inept Takumi
is going to be driving it, too.

277
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,058
Inept, he says.

278
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,719
Takumi'! Is he kidding?

279
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:56,065
It's kind of boring being in high school.

280
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:58,069
You think so'!

281
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,571
I can't wait to start working.

282
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,572
Until you have a real job, you're still a child.

283
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,644
I wanna work and make money.

284
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:12,014
With a good job, I can have my own car.

285
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,019
I can't buy anything now. How pathetic!

286
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,858
Don't be so impatient.

287
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,859
Whether we like it or not,
we're graduating next spring.

288
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,631
I can't wait...

289
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,632
...because there's nothing
worthwhile at school.

290
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,399
You seem down, Takumi.

291
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,026
Wait!

292
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,595
Why have you been avoiding me'!

293
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,398
Did I do something wrong,

294
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,667
or say something hurtful?

295
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:05,668
If so, please tell me. I'll apologize!

296
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,440
Not really.

297
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,276
--Then what's wrong'!
--Nothing's wrong.

298
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,178
Something is clearly wrong!

299
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,179
We were okay until recently.

300
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,249
Now you seem distant. It's not fair.

301
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,753
What's wrong, Takumi'!

302
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,423
I don't know why you're so worked up

303
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,792
about someone like me.

304
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,961
It doesn't matter.

305
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,797
It's not like we're dating.

306
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,798
That doesn't make any sense.
What's going on'!

307
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:38,575
Don't follow me.

308
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:44,217
Good luck with the Mercedes guy.

309
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:48,028
Leave me alone.

310
00:20:52,618 --> 00:20:54,285
<i>What...?</i>

311
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:55,896
