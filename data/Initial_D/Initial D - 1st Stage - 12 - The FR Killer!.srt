What incredible speed!

36
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,133
Brake lights?!

37
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:24,354
Braking while cornering at that speed?!

38
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,978
<i>Darn, I can't keep up.</i>

42
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,495
Thank you very much!

43
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,388
I was really furious!

44
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,389
So, he was braking while
cornering... at high speed'!

45
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,761
I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.

46
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,199
Really?

47
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Everybody does that!

48
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:34,113
I step on the brake while
cornering all the time.

49
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,979
Uh-oh, I'm going too fast...

50
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,215
<i>I'm scared... step, step...</i>

51
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,917
We're not talking about a beginner...

52
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,918
This EG6 cleared those downhill
turns at an incredible speed.

53
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,660
E662

54
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,661
It's a Honda Civic!

55
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,730
Why don't they just call it a Civic, then'!

56
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,001
The Civic is very popular among street racers,

57
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,437
even though it's an FF.

58
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,438
It's a non-turbo 1.6 liter like your Eight-Six,

59
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,842
but its VTEC engine has tons of power.

60
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,015
It has been a rival of the Levin
and the Trueno for years.

61
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,852
As an Eight-Six driver,
you should know about the Civic.

62
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,025
As a Levin driver myself...

63
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,656
...I can't let a Civic pass me!

64
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,964
Anyway, I just can't believe
it went in at that speed

65
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,970
and then braked.

66
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,970
Well, that technique is called left foot braking.

67
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,410
Left foot braking'!

68
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,410
You usually don't use
this technique with an FR,

69
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,883
but you brake with the left foot

70
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,884
to stabilize the car at
an extremely high speed.

71
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,923
With an FF like an EG6,

72
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,625
you need your right foot on
the gas pedal continuously

73
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,061
to avoid understeering,

74
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,731
so you brake with your left foot

75
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:08,732
to take the weight off the rear
tires and turn more sharply.

76
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,535
He must be a highly experienced
FF driver to use that technique.

77
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I'm sure he's fast.

78
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,710
<i>He was pretty fast... That punk...</i>

79
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,848
I only avoided crashing
because I'd just practiced

80
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,853
spinning with the emergency brake.

81
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:30,854
Otherwise, my S13 would've
been in the shop again!

82
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:35,237
<i>I'm gonna make that EGG pay!</i>

83
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,374
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

84
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,139
<i>I'm home...</i>

85
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,140
Hey, someone called for you earlier.

86
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,611
--Who was it'!
--| didn't ask.

87
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:55,247
A <i>girl...</i> A <i>pretty girl.</i>

88
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,048
She said she would call back.

89
00:06:57,049 --> 00:07:00,049
How could you tell she was
pretty over the phone'!

90
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:03,987
I've developed good intuition over the years.

91
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,824
Cars and women... it's all about
experience and intuition.

92
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,610
--Good luck with both of them.
--Yeah, yeah...

93
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:15,018
Well, I'm off to a meeting...

94
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,757
<i>Uh... Fujiwara Tofu Shop...</i>

95
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,758
<i>--Hello, Takumi'!
--Oh... Mogi...</i>

96
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,696
Were you sleeping?

97
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,976
Remember the other day you were saying...?

98
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,483
This better be real,Takumi!

99
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,464
If this turns out to be a joke... you'll be sorry!

100
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,056
Are you sure she's bringing her friend?

101
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,860
Don't worry...

102
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,861
Mogi said she was bringing her friend.

103
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,398
I wonder if she's cute... or has a nice body...

104
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,202
...or maybe she is beautiful!

105
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,206
I think she is Mogi': junior high school friend.

106
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,910
As long as she is decent-looking...

107
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,946
I shouldn't expect too much...

108
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,850
I can't believe you kept your promise, Takumi!

109
00:08:42,054 --> 00:08:45,054
I'm so lucky to have a good friend like you...

110
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,925
It's nothing, really...

111
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:51,556
I'll be the best racer at Mount Akina
with a pretty girl in my arms.

112
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,201
Not on my Levin, you darn pigeons!

113
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,675
They should be here by now...

114
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,676
Hey!

115
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,479
Were you waiting long'!

116
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,015
--Don't do that, Mogi!
--Hi.

117
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:14,766
Itsuki, this is my friend Saori.
Saori, this is Takumi and ltsuki.

118
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,191
Nice meeting you.

119
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,192
You, too.

120
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,221
<i>She's... very pretty...</i>

121
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,707
So you are a street racer'!

122
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,708
Well, I belong to a team
called the Akina Speed Stars,

123
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,779
and I'm the third or fourth fastest...

124
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,883
I'm well known in Gunma
as "Levin of Mount Akina."

125
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,588
Pretty cool!

126
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,690
What's a street racer'!

127
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:54,691
What, you really don't know'!

128
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,561
A street racer is a...

129
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:59,562
<i>Oh, man! She': far beyond my expectations!</i>

130
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,232
Watch out, ltsuki!

131
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,744
--Want me to drive?
--No, I got it.

132
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:15,875
Sorry, a street racer': bad habit...

133
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,162
Feeling Okay?

134
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,353
I'm fine...

135
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,470
He drives kind of rough...

136
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,371
Hey!Takumi and Natsuki!

137
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,510
Look at us!

138
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,681
Why don't you join us'!

139
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,852
They do look good together.

140
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,853
<i>Yeah...</i>

141
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,050
Need a ride home'!

142
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,420
Thank you, but Saori and I
have a lot to catch up on.

143
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,701
I had a good time, ltsuki.
Maybe we'll do it again.

144
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:41,299
--See ya.
--Yeah.

145
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,169
Uh, Saori...

146
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,330
See ya, SaoriH

147
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,396
Yeah!

148
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:03,252
<i>Not bad... she's not bad at all...</i>

149
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,891
Saori.

150
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,892
I feel life energy surging through me...

151
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,697
Saori!

152
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,433
Watch the road, will you'!

153
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,302
Bomtw
any.

154
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,771
I don't know how to thank you,Takumi.

155
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,073
Yippee!

156
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,409
"Maybe we'll do it again," she said...

157
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,312
Maybe just the two of us next time...

158
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,313
“Hey, light!
“Wham?

159
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,606
Sorry... I'm sorry...

160
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,272
Thank you very much!

161
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:59,642
Well, what should I do next'!

162
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,613
Work, work, work...

163
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,614
He's in a good mood. Did he meet a girl'!

164
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:08,684
--Maybe...
--He can't have a girlfriend before I do!

165
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,623
By the way, Takumi,
would you like to drive my S13'!

166
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:20,396
It's refreshing to drive
different cars sometimes.

167
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,968
No, thank you.

168
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,968
I'll pass. I mean... you love that car...

169
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,807
Please, Takumi'!

170
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,808
I can learn so much from watching you drive it.

171
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,478
Please?

172
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:51,493
Are you serious about racing
against the Eight-Six of Mount Akina'!

173
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,232
You'll see.

174
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,237
All right, let's go.

175
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,185
<i>Come on out, Eight-Six of Mount Akina.</i>

176
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,436
<i>I can hardly wait...</i>

177
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:24,562
Do I really have to'!

178
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,031
Please, Takumi.

179
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,233
Just drive normally...

180
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,535
It'll still be educational for me.

181
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,770
I'll owe you big!

182
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,771
I'm not really good with
other people's cars, <i>so...</i>

183
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,711
I don't think I'll be any help...

184
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,712
He's begging this much, so just this once?

185
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,384
Yeah, Takumi. Just this once.

186
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:49,385
Okay, just this once, then.

187
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,389
Please don't expect too much.

188
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,258
You will'!

189
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,449
Yeah!

190
00:14:59,965 --> 00:15:02,965
All right, lketani. Just don't faint again...

191
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:06,602
Don't worry, this is my second time around...

192
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,007
Bring it on,Takumi!

193
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,438
--Here we go, then.
--Yeah!

194
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,554
What should I do first'!

195
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,555
Well, how about showing me a braking drift?

196
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,626
Okay.

197
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:34,766
<i>Wha... hey...</i>

198
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,107
Are you doing it at the first turn'!

199
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:43,025
Aren't we going in a little too fast...'!

200
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,097
I hope lketani': all right.

201
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:21,046
It's...

202
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:21,179
"lketani Passes Out!"
It's...

203
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,115
"lketani Passes Out!"
"Wow! <i>I...</i> I saw it!

204
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,884
"Iketani Passes Out!" The agonized cry of
his last moment echoed through Mt. Akina!

205
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,087
"Iketani Passes Out!"
The scary downhill!

206
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:32,088
"Iketani Passes Out!"
lketani, in the third corner...

207
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,092
"lketani Passes Out!"

208
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,794
"lketani Passes Out!"
...passed out!"

209
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:36,961
...passed out!"

210
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,392
...all over again, perhaps.

211
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,812
<i>He can drift effortlessly in a
car he's never driven before...</i>

212
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,649
<i>I never knew my $13 could go this fast!</i>

213
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,154
It's different from my Eight-Six,
but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

214
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,993
But we only went through three turns...

215
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,731
I'm ready for a drift.

216
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,922
<i>A drift? Then what was he doing before?</i>

217
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,099
I think I got it right on that last turn.

218
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:56,244
<i>It': too advanced for me to understand...</i>

219
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,561
They're back!

220
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:25,336
Oh, man.You made it this time.

221
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:28,072
You've conquered it!

222
00:18:28,073 --> 00:18:31,073
So, did you get a good look
at his braking drift, lketani'!

223
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,881
Not really... no idea...

224
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,882
So much for begging him to show you how.

225
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,286
Yeah, but he made it look
so simple that I realized...

226
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,095
...I'm not even close to
understanding his technique!

227
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,096
I feel like a better racer already!

228
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:56,566
Wham'!

229
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:13,251
That's the EG6 from yesterday!

230
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:50,421
That punk!

231
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,690
Hey, you!

232
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,691
I know you're the one who
hit me from behind yesterday.

233
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,363
Who are you'!

234
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,363
Don't tell me you forgot this S13!

235
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,036
Oh, you...

236
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,037
That's right! You owe me an apology.

237
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,875
I could've gotten badly hurt.

238
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,876
Are you kidding me'! That was your fault.

239
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,080
What'!

240
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Your car was going so slow
that I couldn't anticipate it.

241
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,884
I never thought you could
attack a corner that slowly.

242
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,321
I tried to brake, but... bump.

243
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:27,425
What did you say?!

244
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,727
Calm down, lketani!

245
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,662
What a jerk!

246
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:34,663
Stepping all over lketani': pride...

247
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,068
If you insist, then we'll race under my rules.

248
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:43,005
If I lose, I'll be on the ground
begging for your forgiveness.

249
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:46,108
What do you mean, "your" rules'!

250
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,513
It's nothing.

251
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:51,513
We call it the "duct tape death match."

252
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,484
Duct tape death match'!

253
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,921
Duct tape the right hand
to the steering wheel...

254
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,192
...and then race.That's all.

255
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,762
Duct tape the right hand
to the steering wheel'!

256
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,534
Your shifting hand stays free...

257
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,535
<i>My right hand and the steering wheel...</i>

258
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,607
You can't switch hands...

259
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,824
You can't steer!

260
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:25,217
Too dangerous...

261
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,718
For you, definitely.

262
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,719
I hear the Speed Stars' Eight-Six
is a downhill specialist.

263
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:37,963
Maybe this kid can help you out'!

264
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,840
Tell this Eight-Six kid

265
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,910
that I'll be waiting here
next Saturday at 10 p.m.

266
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,444
We'll have a duct tape death match...

267
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,434
I'll see you then.
