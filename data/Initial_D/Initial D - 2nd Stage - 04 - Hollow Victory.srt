I just don't understand one thing, Keisuke.

00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,102
Yeah'!

38
00:03:24,103 --> 00:03:27,103
Even if he sticks like super glue,

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
how can he pass the Evo IV
with his inferior Eight-Six'!

40
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,778
I understand that downhill
minimizes the power difference,

41
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,782
but it can never make
the Eight-Six more powerful.

42
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,454
He's slower on the straightaways,

43
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,455
and since they're equally skilled,
it's almost impossible

44
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,026
for him to get ahead at a corner.

45
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,547
If he can't get ahead, he'll lose.

46

is the answer to your question.

<i>I don'! get it.</i>

49
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,812
<i>He can'! get ahead.</i>

50
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,423
<i>It': impossible!</i>

51
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:21,825
<i>He shortens the gap right
before we enter each corner.</i>

52
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,838
<i>Bu! it's partly because my from
tires have lost some pressure.</i>

53
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,603
<i>It': an Eight-Six, after all.</i>

54
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,939
<i>It has slow acceleration.</i>

55
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,940
<i>I can always pull away after a tum.</i>

56
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,045
<i>It pays to be in from, Kyoichi.</i>

57
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:43,046
<i>Unless I make a stupid mistake, this race is...</i>

58
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,506
<i>...100% mine.</i>

59
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,354
<i>He': fast.</i>

60
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,690
<i>He's the fastest I've seen,</i>

61
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,241
<i>as far as acceleration after a turn is concerned.</i>

62
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:02,632
<i>I can'! stick with him. He has too much power.</i>

63
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,339
<i>I've never felt this way before.</i>

64
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,584
<i>Even with the "ditch" tum, Pm falling behind.</i>

65
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,489
<i>To offset my slow acceleration,</i>

66
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,490
<i>I have to exit comers at a much
higher speed than he does.</i>

67
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,661
<i>Then I can catch him before the next comer.</i>

68
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,699
<i>I guess I have to do what I did
against Ryosuke Takahashi.</i>

69
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,104
<i>The Ditch Tum No. 2...</i>

70
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:41,573
<i>...for faster exit acceleration.</i>

71
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:44,574
<i>The comer before the bridge is the place.</i>

72
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,111
<i>Can I catch the ditch correctly
if! charge in at top speed?</i>

73
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,636
<i>I have one chance!</i>

74
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:55,896
<i>Pm different tonight.</i>

75
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,059
They're close!

76
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,060
They're just around the corner.

77
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,365
<i>Honestly...</i>

78
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,366
<i>...I'm not 100% sure if he
can actually pass the Evo IV.</i>

79
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,472
<i>I just want to believe
that no one can beat him...</i>

80
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:16,473
<i>...when my brother couldn't.</i>

81
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,378
<i>Don'! lose!</i>

82
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,769
<i>I won'! forgive you if you lose
to anyone before our rematch.</i>

83
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,589
The Eight-Six is behind!

84
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,462
<i>NOW!</i>

85
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,499
<i>I won! This is the end.</i>

86
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,154
<i>He disappeared.</i>

87
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,285
What the heck?!

88
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,286
He caught the Evo IV at the turn': exit.

89
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,260
What happened?!

90
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,128
It's over.

91
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,191
<i>He got inside.</i>

92
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,971
<i>How?! Wsjust an old junker,
so how can it be so fast?!</i>

93
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:31,216
<i>Damn, I can't control the tires.</i>

94
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,967
<i>Damn it!</i>

95
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,723
What an incredible race!
What will happen next'!

96
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,928
Nothing. It's over.

97
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:48,097
It was over when he moved next
to the Evo IV before this turn.

98
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,205
There's no way to pass him now.

99
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,206
<i>Man, he showed him up big time.</i>

100
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,542
<i>You're unreal, Takumi Fujiwara.</i>

101
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,380
--The Eight-Six is in front!
--He won!

102
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,811
Akina's Eight-Six has stopped
Team Emperor's sweep!

103
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,821
Unbelievable. He beat the Ian-Evo.

104
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:14,245
It's creepy.

105
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,506
<i>I don'! feel like I won. Because it': Akina?</i>

106
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,545
<i>I knew exactly where to attack</i>

107
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:36,546
<i>and when to use the "ditch" tum.</i>

108
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,571
<i>I would've lost anywhere else.</i>

109
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,997
Sorry, Kyoichi.

110
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:54,998
Do you have any idea why I'm mad, Seiji'!

111
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,036
Do you think you can explain

112
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,839
why you lost this race'!

113
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,840
No, I don't. I just couldn't shake him off.

114
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,877
I don't know how that slow
Eight-Six could keep up with me,

115
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,548
or what kind of technique he used.

116
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,286
Of course not.

117
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:17,287
How could you see anything
in the rearview mirror'!

118
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,490
You could've observed
much more from behind.

119
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,994
"Simulation 3" was for that very reason.

120
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,232
Had you listened to me,

121
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,001
you wouldn't have suffered an ugly loss.

122
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:33,002
Stop acting like a stupid monkey
and start using your head!

123
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,374
I apologize.

124
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,375
What do we do now, Kyoichi'!

125
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,378
Our plan to sweep Gunma is no more.

126
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,049
But regret won't erase this defeat.

127
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:49,385
We'll suck it up and head to Akagi next.

128
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:51,028
The Red Suns'!

129
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:55,391
My ultimate target is Ryosuke Takahashi.

130
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,394
If we win in Akagi, I'll be satisfied.

131
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,665
I just have to win.

132
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,666
What about the Eight-Six, Kyoichi'!

133
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:06,669
We have our pride.
We can't just accept the defeat.

134
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:10,206
Shut up! You don't have to tell me that!

135
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,111
Just leave him to me.

136
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,448
<i>Pm the one who is the most upset about this.</i>

137
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,719
That was so satisfying last night!

138
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,755
I've never felt that satisfied before.

139
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,293
I remember the Evo IV guy with the ponytail

140
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,629
trashed us at the lake by saying,

141
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,630
"An Eight-Six racer isn't worthy of my time."

142
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,967
lwish I could just rub it in his face.

143
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:41,204
Right, Takumi'! Wasn't it satisfying?

144
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,241
It wasn't satisfying.

145
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,977
What'! Why not?

146
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,978
I've had this vague thought lately,

147
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:52,117
but it became clear last night.

148
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,486
I don't like racing in Akina.

149
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,455
--I'm done racing here.
--Yeah, right.

150
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,456
When you think, nothing good comes out of it.

151
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,494
What's wrong with Akina'!

152
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,495
I don't think I won the race last night.

153
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,898
I actually feel like I lost.

154
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,769
Hold on,Takumi! Why are you upset'!

155
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,441
I'm not upset.

156
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,277
Declaring my plans to you does no good,

157
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,579
but I'm done with Akina.

158
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,580
I've decided to race elsewhere,

159
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,774
even if it means a defeat.

160
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,675
<i>Again?</i>

161
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,853
There you are. Hey, Takumi!

162
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,854
Big news! Akagi will be hot this weekend!

163
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,858
Team Emperor and the Red Suns are facing off!

164
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,697
We can't miss that!

165
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:15,333
Rumor has it the guy with the black Ian-Evo

166
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,202
is racing for Team Emperor.

167
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,203
Ryosuke Takahashi will race for the Red Suns!

168
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:24,127
Hey, Takumi, are you listening to me'!

169
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,751
Hey! What's the matter, Takumi'!

170
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,452
Nothing.

171
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,900
When Takumi looks spaced out,

172
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,405
that means he's thinking
about something, right, ltsuki'!

173
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:57,406
That's actually very rare.

174
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,110
Most of the time, he's just spaced out

175
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,148
and not thinking about anything.

176
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,984
Which one is it today'!

177
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:09,415
I have no idea, but he's acting weird today.

178
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:18,174
--A black Evo Ill!
--Is that him'!

179
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,313
--It's him!
--Emperor!

180
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:38,181
Why don't you come to Akagi'!

181
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,919
Come to Akagi and race me.

182
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,921
A challenge!

183
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,922
No. But you guys probably don't get it.

184
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,127
Do you still remember what
I said to you by the lake'!

185
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,098
You're talented,

186
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:56,935
but you have no chance as
long as you drive an Eight-Six.

187
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,470
That's what I said.

188
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,307
I can show you what I meant by that.

189
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,308
If you race me, you'll see things
you didn't realize before.

190
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,846
Come to Akagi today or tomorrow, if you like.

191
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,317
I'll give you a preliminary race

192
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,652
before facing the Red Suns.

193
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,155
Unlike the Akina races you're used to,

194
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,156
it'll be a quick defeat for you.

195
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,879
But in that quick race,
you may learn something new.

196
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,767
If you understand me, come to Akagi.

197
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:31,728
That's all I wanted to say.

198
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,879
What nonsense! Who does he think he is'!

199
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,850
You don't have to go there, Takumi.

200
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:47,852
I know that.

201
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,787
He acted all cool,

202
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,788
but I bet hejust wants revenge in Akagi.

203
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,359
I bet he does!

204
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
But I've decided not to race in Akina anymore.

205
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,899
What'!

206
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
If Akagi weren't crowded for
the Emperor-Red Suns challenge,

207
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,039
--| would probably go.
--Takumi!

208
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,730
I hate for him to think that
I chickened out, but I'll pass.

209
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,688
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"

210
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,541
I saw it, Bunta.

211
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,542
I saw your son race in Akina.

212
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,114
Considering how good he already is,

213
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,550
this engine will be gone soon.

214
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:55,053
It'll be sooner than later.

215
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,454
What are you gonna do'!

216
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:59,455
You said you wouldn't
replace it until he lost a race.

217
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:04,493
I wasn't planning on him lasting this long.

218
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,998
He just refuses to lose.

219
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,001
Will the engine blow first, or will he lose first'!

220
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:16,638
Either way, the new one is ready to go.

221
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,330
<i>That note...</i>

222
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,389
<i>"Mashed Magi.</i>

223
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:38,006

224
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,784
<i>What the hell was that, then?</i>

225
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:02,937
Hello'!

226
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,360
So, there's no way you'll change your mind'!

227
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,633
<i>No.</i>

228
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,634
<i>A family restaurant near Maebashi?</i>

229
00:17:20,172 --> 00:17:23,952
<i>Do you really want me to go? Fine.</i>

230
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,147
Dad, I need to run an errand.

231
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:30,548
Okay.

232
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,389
<i>I can'! get this out of my head.</i>

233
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,659
<i>The more I try to forget it, the more
I think about it and get irritated.</i>

234
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,700
<i>Maybe I like Magi that much.</i>

235
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,373
<i>So...</i>

236
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,214
<i>...it's silly, but just this once, H! fall for it.</i>

237
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,654
<i>This is it.</i>

238
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:18,765
<i>A Mercedes.</i>

239
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,964
Papa,thank you for
understanding my selfishness.

240
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,395
Papa,thank you for
understanding my selfishness.

241
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,875
How's it going, Seiji'!

242
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,876
I'm more than ready to go.

243
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,879
I already have a strategy for this course.

244
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,383
It was kind of annoying to
see the Red Suns' lackeys

245
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,686
timing me at every check point.

246
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,057
Ignore them.

247
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:56,058
As long as you know the course perfectly,

248
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:59,562
the strategy's basically the same for any pass.

249
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,566
By the way, do you think he'll come'!

250
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,403
Who knows'!

251
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:08,404
I would say there's about
a 40% chance he'll show up.

252
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,111
It's more convenient for us if he comes.

253
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:17,112
The truth is that I want to be
done with these little chores

254
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,284
--before I face Ryosuke Takahashi.
--Yeah.

255
00:20:20,285 --> 00:20:23,285
Our ultimate goal is to conquer all of Gunma.

256
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,223
Once I defeat Ryosuke,
we're done with Gunma.

257
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,527
But I can't sleep well at night

258
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:35,097
knowing that we let one escape in Akina.

259
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Hopefully, I can destroy the
Eight-Six in a warm-up race

260
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:41,763
and go into the main event refreshed.

261
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,223
That was him that just headed up.

262
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,111
