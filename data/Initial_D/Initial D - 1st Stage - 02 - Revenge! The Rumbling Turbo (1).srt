Yeah. I just got my license.

00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,732
Okay, then let's go for a drive
during summer vacation.

and I'll make lunch for us.

64
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,208
...the car is used for business,
so it is pretty sad-looking.

I don't care about that.

know what an Eight-Six was, but...

105
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,254
...the car at your house is an Eight-Six.

106
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,360
What'! Hold on a minute.

107
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,895
That's not an Eight-Six.

108
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,896
I'm pretty sure it says "Trueno" on the back.

109
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,901
Right. ATrueno is an Eight-Six.

110
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,902
The AE86 chassis Levin and Trueno

111

114
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:23,382
Are you serious, lketani?

115
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,384
Yes, I'm serious.

116
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,019
Takumi, you jerk!

117
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:30,019
Why did you keep it a secret?!

118
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,089
What could I do'! I didn't even know.

119
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,560
If it's a Trueno, just say it's a Trueno.

120
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,561
You said it's an "Eight-Six,"
but normal people don't call it that.

121
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,565
Why, you...!

122
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,470
By the way, let's have a little talk.

--Why'!
--Isn't it obvious?

125
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:54,577
To go watch the Speed Stars
and Red Suns meet, of course!

126
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,117
Since yesterday's incident,

127
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,720
I'm really into the street racing scene!

128
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:04,721
Don't you want to see Akagi's
fastest drivers, the Takahashi Brothers?

129
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,693
Not really.

130
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:10,729
What?!

131
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,730
How can you say that'!
Even to your own friend?!

132
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,935
I beg you...

133
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,936
Give me a ride in the
Eight-Six on Saturday, please?

134
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,074
Hey, you guys.

135
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,074
What are you standing around for'!
A customer is waiting.

136
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:27,045
Yes, yes! I'm sorry!

137
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,046
Welcome!

138
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,059
You're putting on brand-new tires?

139
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,428
You must have spent a lot.

140
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,428
It's only the tires, but I need
high grip to reduce my times.

141
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,067
I'm also replacing the brake pads.

142
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:51,770
On the downhill, braking is crucial.

143
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,405
Will you run, lketani?

144
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:56,406
Yes. I'll run the downhill.

145
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,609
I'll attack Akina': downhill
as if I've got a death wish.

146
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,547
Don't overdo it.

147
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,382
One mistake on the downhill can be fatal.

148
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,684
I understand.

149
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,685
I understand, but I have to
overdo it just a little bit...

150
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,445
...for the pride of our hometown.

151

153
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,419
<i>Maybe the driver wasn't a local?</i>

154
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,420
<i>No, that's impossible. He was totally
familiar with this mountain.</i>

155
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,525
<i>I want to face him again.
If! don't get my revenge,</i>

156
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,795
<i>then I won'! calm down!</i>

157
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,264

00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,941
<i>I came here to face you.</i>

161
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:05,008
Wow! The one and only Drift King,
Keiichi Tsuchiya! I can't believe it!

162
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:09,126
It looks like he can control it
just by using the gas pedal.

163
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,017
Takumi...

164
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,018
Don't you wish we could go out
right now and driftjust like this'!

165
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:19,656
--Sure.
--Check out this drift! Awesome!

166
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,594
Sure.

167
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:24,563
Takumi...

168
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,998
Sure.

169
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,999
Hey! You keep saying, "Sure. Sure."
Do you even know what drift is'!

170
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,572
Sure, I know what drift is.

171
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,573
Well, then, can you tell us what it is'!

172
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,278
<i>In</i> a <i>curve...</i>

173
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,713
DQhlt Say "c urvQ u o “Qt QQQ I.

174
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:44,714
Street racers say "corner."

175
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,752
Okay, in a corner...

176
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,188
...you make the front tires slide

177
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,591
so that the car won't face the inside.

178
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,592
What?!

179
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,598
That's a good one, Takumi!

180
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,599
If the front tires are sliding,
that's called "understeer,"

181
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:05,470
which is totally uncool
and for people with no skill.

182
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,772
A true drift isn't in the front--

183
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,641
it's in the rear.

184
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,543
You're really funny.

185
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,544
--That was great, Takumi!
--It definitely was!

186
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,283
<i>lketani, you're the one
who doesn't understand.</i>

187
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,151
<i>While in the middle of a drift,</i>

188
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,721
<i>the car is basically understeering.</i>

189
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:25,722
<i>That was the highly advanced answer of those</i>

190
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,926
<i>who have mastered the four-wheel drift.</i>

191
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:30,795
<i>Pm impressed.</i>

192
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,796
Customers are here! Get to work.

193
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,301
Yes, sir!

194
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,342
--Welcome!
--Welcome!

195
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,781
<i>An FD...</i>

196
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,781
<i>Could it be Keisuke Takahashi?</i>

197
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,321
High octane, fill it up.

198
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,321
Yes, sir.

199
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,010
You're a real enthusiast.

200
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,036
I see. I thought I had seen
that S13 somewhere before...

201
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,739
The Speed Stars.

202
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,383
Can I ask you one thing?

203
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,086
You'd be the one who'd know...

204
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,622
ls there a ghost on Mt. Akina?

205
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,723
The ghost of a super fast Eight-Six.

206
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:40,496
Wow. Is he planning to fly with this'!

207
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:43,566
Please don't joke around with me, sir.

208
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,472
The part about the ghost was a joke,

209
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,841
but it's a black-and-white panda Trueno.

210
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,810
On the outside, it's a normal Eight-Six...

211
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,579
...but inside, it's an incredible monster.

212
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,830
There's no way a local like
you doesn't know about it.

213
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,586
Well, fine then.

214
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,587
If that's your secret weapon
for this Saturday's meet,

215
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,058
then I just got my wish.

216
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,861
Tell the driver of that Eight-Six

217
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,862
that I won't lose to the same guy twice.

218
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,401
The reason I lost last time

219
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,181
is because I didn't know
the course and I got careless.

220
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:21,638
Thanks for coming.

221
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,610
<i>Keisuke Takahashi lost?</i>

222
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:26,945
<i>What did he mean?</i>

223
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,756
<i>I don'! know anything about such an Eight-Six.</i>

224
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,920
<i>Could it be...?</i>

225
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
<i>The Eight-Six! saw at Takumi': house</i>

226
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,625
<i>was a panda Trueno.</i>

227
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,626
<i>Was the boss telling the truth?</i>

228
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:47,032
<i>The fastest on the downhill
is still that Eight-Six?</i>

229
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:00,177
"Green Shopping Street"

230
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,485
All right, that's it for today.

231
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,650
Isn't this a lot more than usual'!

232
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,119
It's fine. Just don't spill any.

233
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
I know.

234
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,773
Your face is sleepy as usual, Takumi.

235
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,774
Sorry, but I was born with this face.

236
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,545
Don't forget the Eight-Six on Saturday.

237
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:46,417
I know. You're so persistent, ltsuki.

238
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,418
If I don't make sure about it,
you might back out on me.

239
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,391
Please, Saturday, come quickly!

240
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,393
I'm totally excited!

241
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,394
Hey, if both of us aim to become street racers,

242
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,731
maybe someday we'll be
known as the fastest on Akina.

243
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,167
I don't really care either way.

244
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,204
Well, even if you tried,
it'd be hopeless for you.

245
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,340
After seeing you scream in
the back seat of lketani': car,

246
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,945
it's obvious you don't have an ounce of talent.

247
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,681
But I'm different!

248
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,782
I was a little bit scared,

249
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,783
but I was able to look at the
corner exit with my teeth clenched.

250
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,521
Even lketani has faith in me!

251
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:27,712
He must thinkTakumi is hopeless,
but I have a bright future!

252
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,462
Huh? Takumi?

253
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,964
Takumi!

254
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:35,965
Takumi!Takumi, wait a second!

255
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,537
What's wrong with you'! I know
you're jealous of my talent,

256
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,306
but aren't you being a bit cold'!

257
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,541
<i>I'm not...</i>

258
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:46,542
And then Rumiko told my boyfriend
all about it. He got really mad!

259
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,314
I saw.

260
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,416
You like that kind of stuff'!

261
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,718
Of course not!

262
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,718
It must be a crime to let them
make their skirts that short.

263
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,229
The school should make a new rule...

264
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
Lucky!

265
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,701
Good morning, Takumi!

266
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:12,070
M0gi?!

267
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,772
That's right. I have to talk
to you about something.

268
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,773
Come along, quickly!

269
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,807
What is this?! What the hell is going on here?!

270
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,018
What's wrong'!

271
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,019
<i>Well... I...</i>

272
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:33,255
There's something I want to tell you.

273
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:36,593
What is it'!

274
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,199
<i>Well...</i>

275
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,101
<i>I...</i>

276
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:45,370
I bought a new bathing suit!

277
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,605
It's totally cute.

278
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:49,807
Is that what you wanted to tell me'!

279
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,376
Bingo.

280
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,377
I was so happy that I just had
to tell somebody about it!

281
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,250
Wanna see it'! Are you
wondering what color it is'!

282
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,019
You want to see it soon, right'!

283
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,521
Well, I want to, but...

284
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,423
I'll let you see as much as you like

285
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,259
when we go to the ocean, okay'!

286
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,259
<i>Until then, just... you... wait... and... see.</i>

287
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,931
How about this Sunday? Are you free'!

288
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:16,667
Yes. I have a break from work.

289
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,936
Okay, it's decided. It's a promise.

290
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:21,406
A promise should never be broken.

291
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,508
There are only two kinds of people that I hate.

292
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:25,699
People who break their promises
and people who smoke.

293
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,101
<i>Damn. it': too tough.</i>

294
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,102
<i>The comers that I never thought of as comers</i>

295
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:56,040
<i>are becoming more and more dreadful.</i>

296
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,209
<i>These comers that I am so familiar with</i>

297
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,640
<i>have now begun to show their fangs!</i>

298
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,768
<i>It': no use. Even if! push myself to the limit,</i>

299
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,906
<i>I can'! cut my time: down.</i>

300
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:31,907
<i>I thought that if I gave it more throttle,
I could cut my times down.</i>

301
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,412
<i>But it': not that simple.</i>

302
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,413
<i>Is this the limit of my technique?</i>

303
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,907
<i>There': no way I can compete with them.</i>

304
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,757
Hello! Excuse me!

305
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,095
Hello?!

306
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,534
Excuse me!

307
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,534
I can hear you. Give me a minute.

308
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:00,604
Sure.

309
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,574
Welcome.

310
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:06,410
<i>Is this the Eight-Six driver
and the fastest on Akina?</i>

311
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:09,751
<i>Is this the guy who defeated
Keisuke Takahashi': FD?</i>

312
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,417
What do you want'!

313
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,418
Sir;

314
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,022
Fried tofu, please.

315
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,557
Coming right up.

316
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,426
<i>What am I doing?!</i>

317
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,262
<i>Um... I...</i>

318
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,031
My name is lketani,

319
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:29,131
and I'm with a street racing team
called the Akina Speed Stars.

320
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,337
The truth is, I heard this strange rumor

321
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,242
that the fastest downhill driver on Mt. Akina

322
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,243
is an Eight-Six driven by
the owner of a tofu shop.

323
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,014
I don't know who told you that, but it's not me.

324
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,286
Please don't play dumb!

325
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:51,287
I searched the whole city, and this is
the only tofu shop with an Eight-Six!

326
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,025
Here you go. 140 yen.

327
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,397
Thank you.

328
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,398
Well... I'm kind of in a tough situation.

329
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,035
Can you please listen to what I have to say'!

330
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,071
What a bother. Right in
the middle of my work...

331
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:12,064
But you're not doing anything!
I'm the only customer here!

332
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,579
That was rude, saying something like that...

333
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:20,249
I'm sorry, but I'm desperate.

334
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,421
The truth is, a team called the Akagi Red Suns

335
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,422
challenged us to a time attack battle.

336
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,425
The Red Suns have some drivers
with awesome technique.

337
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:33,162
Nobody on our team can compete with them.

338
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,465
But since this is our mountain,
we definitely don't want to lose!

339
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,838
So what do you want me to do'!

340
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,289
Mr. Fujiwara... Please teach me
how to tackle Mt. Akina.

341
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,414
That's an impossible request.

342
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,918
Please! Even just enough to make
me a tenth of a second faster!

343
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:58,155
I beg you!

344
00:20:58,156 --> 00:20:59,790
I know how you feel,

345
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,791
but driving technique cannot be
improved in two or three days.

346
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,362
In order to make your car do what you want,

347
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,765
you have to think continuously
and practice on your own.

348
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:12,203
When I was actively racing,

349
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:15,204
I was tackling Akina even in my dreams.

350
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,274
Technique isn't something that can be taught.

351
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,920
It's something you find on your own.

352
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:29,752
Sorry... I can't help you.

353
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,819
Mr. Fujiwara, I'll be back again.

354
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,410
<i>"Think continuously and
practice on your own..."</i>

355
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,413
<i>I've done that, but my time:
haven't improved a bit.</i>

356
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,616
<i>Why not?!</i>

357
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,624
<i>Dammit! No matter how hard I try,
I just can't understand it!</i>

358
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,516
<i>I can'! avoid it! Please! Get to the inside!</i>

359
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,497

<i>Mr. Buma, according to your theory,</i>

392

<i>driving technique cannot be taught.</i>

393
