Did you see that, big brother?!

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,784
Yeah. I guess...

22
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,785
...Kyoichi is scheming behind the scenes.

23
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:05,188
Can we let him race the Emperor?

24
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:08,225
There's no way he can pull it off this time!

But, big brother...

00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,882
In the race I saw,

30
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:31,817
he totally exceeded my expectations.

31
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,451
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"
he totally exceeded my expectations.

I can't believe he's only 18.

00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:35,854
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"
Come on, now.

34
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,855
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop" When I was 18,
I was far more capable than that.

35
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,094
"Fujiwara Tofu Shop"
You may be the only one who thinks so.

36
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:42,675
You may be the only one who thinks so.

Yuichi says your son is more talented than you.

38
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,067
He says you just don't want
to accept your son's talent

39
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,584
because you're so stubborn.

40
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,712
Anyway, when he exceeds his limits,

41
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,314
so will the engine.

42
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,315
Sooner or later, it'll blow.

43
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:08,045
Can he keep winning until then'!

Here's the Eight-Six.

Thank you for showing up.

As promised, I'll be your opponent.

That's the least I can do for your trouble.

But I won't take it easy.

51
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,974

00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,973
The Emperors came to rile up Takumi?!

62
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,544
They showed up here'!

63
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:15,545
I bet they really regret
losing to Takumi in Akina.

64
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,382
After all, they came to Gunma
planning to sweep the area.

65
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,424
What did Takumi say'!

66
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,492
He's not interested.

67
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,661
That's good.

68
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,496
He has no reason to go to Akagi

69
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,497
and battle it out with that monstrous Ian-Evo.

70
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,536
Yes.

71
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,167
Okay, I see.

72
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,609
This is weird.

73
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,111
What's wrong, ltsuki'!

74
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,113
Takumi isn't home.

75
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:51,114
He got a phone call, and then he just took off.

76
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,451
A phone call'!

77
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,452
I forgot to set my VCR to tape a show tonight,

78
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,122
so I wanted to ask him to tape it for me.

79
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,193
Did he take the car'!

80
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,628
I think so.

81
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,198
I know! He has a date!

82
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,166
With that girl.

83
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,502
<i>Natsuki Magi'!</i>

84
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,503
That's her. I'm positive.

85
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,874
I envy him.

86
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,143
If I had a cute girl like that,

87
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,144
I wouldn't be killing time here with you.

88
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,049
What are you saying, Kenji?!

89
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,385
We racers don't need girls!

90
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,321
"Right, lketani'!
"Right!

91
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,252
<i>They're pathetic!</i>

92
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,653
I want you to know that I
don't consider this a race.

93
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,445
I'm going to teach you the
difference between a fun car...

94
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,452
<i>wand a fast car.</i>

95
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,323
This is a seminar.

96
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,638
I'm ready.

97
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,755
There he goes!

98
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:32,015
Go get him, Kyoichi!

99
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,485
<i>This is hard for me to comprehend.</i>

100
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,523
<i>He intentionally threw himself</i>

101
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,774
<i>into this unevenly matched race.</i>

102
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,364
<i>How can an obsolete Eight-Six</i>

103
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,365
<i>defeat Kyoichi': perfectly tuned Evo III?</i>

104
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:53,338
<i>And this isn't Akina, either.</i>

105
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,339
<i>Is that guy too stupid to realize that?</i>

106
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,077
<i>Does he trust his instincts
and experience that much?</i>

107
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,577
<i>I don'! understand what he': thinking.</i>

108
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,151
<i>Or does he believe he
actually has a chance to win?</i>

109
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,161
<i>Maybe he is...</i>

110
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,979
<i>...a racing genius in the making!</i>

111
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,763
Unbelievable! They're really racing!

112
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,668
<i>Watch me, Ryosuke.</i>

113
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,159
<i>4WD cars can'! lose to 2WD cars.</i>

114
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:06,111
<i>This race also serves as a
challenge sent out to you.</i>

115
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,417
Watch out! He's swinging wide!

116
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,878
That Eight-Six is amazing!

117
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,879
He was just inches from
that vine-covered guardrail!

118
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,051
Is he insane?!

119
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:48,632
Even Akagi racers don't
attack that corner like that!

120
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:00,997
Big brother... the Evo lll's noisy
backfire didn't sound normal.

121
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,704
I noticed that, too.

122
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,705
That Evo Ill has the same system

123
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:10,921
that a WRC rally car has.

124
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:15,578
The misfiring system!

125
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,715
It's a good strategy by Kyoichi.

126
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,884
It's the best system imaginable

127
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,887
for a turbo car on a downhill course.

128
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,292
Akagi': slope is much more severe

129
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,861
than those ofAkina and Myogi.

130
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,197
Right after the start is a low-speed section

131
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:34,532
where they go straight down the hill

132
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,533
in a short amount of time.

133
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,603
Controlling the braking and steering

134
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,790
rather than abusing the power is the key.

135
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,611
He developed his technique
in the Gymkhana circuit,

136
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,241
so he's exceptional at slow corners.

137
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:57,288
He certainly has better technique now

138
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,289
than he did a year ago.

139
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,499
This new Kyoichi is a tough opponent.

140
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:12,224
<i>The belief that 4WD cars can't tum is obsolete.</i>

141
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,881
<i>My Evo H! can tum!</i>

142
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:54,893
<i>I'm being hunted down... like helpless prey.</i>

143
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,521
The Evo Ill sure is fast!

144
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,391
It even challenges the Eight-Six at the corners.

145
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,060
A better car or better skill'!

146
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,311
It's both! Sudo': cornering is unreal!

147
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,535
You know how Kyoichi Sudo races, right'!

148
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,539
What's his style?

149
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,540
He never makes mistakes.

150
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,277
He sticks with the basics
and avoids flashy moves.

151
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,447
In a race, he patiently tests
his opponent's weaknesses.

152
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,451
He will choose the most rational way to win.

153
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:40,223
He won't self-destruct, then.

154
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,927
He's different from Seiji.

155
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,928
Rationality is Kyoichi': bible.

156
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,098
That's why he's only interested in 4WD cars.

157
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,970
Against an equally skilled opponent,
he'll make sure his car

158
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,608
is better-equipped to win the race.

159
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,877
He's like that.

160
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,878
You sound rather bitter.

161
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,016
Idislike him.

162
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,417
I certainly don't want to lose to him.

163
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,822
<i>That firing sound is so noisy!</i>

164
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,998
<i>I can'! stand it!</i>

165
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,780
<i>His adaptability is exceptional.</i>

166
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:41,554
<i>He has no prior experience on this course.</i>

167
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,622
<i>But he can still race at this pace.</i>

168
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,593
<i>What an unbelievable "downhill" sense.</i>

169
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,629
<i>But no more playing around.</i>

170
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,652
<i>H! end this shortly.</i>

171
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,291
Thank you very much!

172
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,992
<i>M091!</i>

173
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,322
Takumi': girlfriend?

174
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,224
I got you something.

175
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:22,026
Thank you so much!

176
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,928
I'm haPPy-

177
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,363
Where is Takumi'!

178
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,364
His shift ended at 5:00 today.

179
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,568
You haven't seen him'!

180
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,570
<i>No.</i>

181
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,571
I thought you were with him.

182
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,575
There it is, my favorite cheesecake!

183
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,413
Bon appétit!

184
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:46,514
IfTakumi isn't on a date, where did he go'!

185
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:51,456
You said he took the Eight-Six, right'!

186
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,358
Yeah.

187
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,359
He may have taken the Emperors' bait

188
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,463
and gone to Akagi.

189
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,924
No way!

190
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,529
<i>Takumi went to Akagi?</i>

191
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,497
<i>We're entering the flatter,
mid-speed section here.</i>

192
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:39,455
<i>Without a slope, he's as slow as a turtle.</i>

193
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,888
<i>The next "S" tum will do.</i>

194
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:59,579
<i>He can'! avoid my counterattack.</i>

195
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,028
There!

196
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,835
<i>No way!</i>

197
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,836
<i>This is a short, full-blast section.</i>

198
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,380
<i>What acceleration!</i>

199
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,749
<i>He': charging in from the outside.</i>

200
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,770
<i>Challenging the Eight-Six at a comer?!</i>

201
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,870
<i>He'll take the inside
position at the next comer.</i>

202
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:46,068
<i>And with that amazing acceleration...</i>

203
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,412
<i>...the Eight-Six is going down!</i>

204
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,552
What?! The Evo Ill took the lead'!

205
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:04,022
At a corner'!

206
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,857
<i>Yeah...</i>

207
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,026
Yeah.

208
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,217
Yeah. I see.

209
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,700
Big brother?

210
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,036
It's just like Kyoichi.

211
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,037
He chose not to attack
at the steep-slope section.

212
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,041
He waited until the Eight-Six
lost speed on the flatter section.

213
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,978
With his technique and the Evo lll's abilities,

214
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,315
Kyoichi could've taken the lead earlier.

215
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,316
But he waited until he had
a surefire chance to pass.

216
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,423
That's the Kyoichi I know.

217
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:41,424
Will the Eight-Six have a
chance to regain the lead'!

218
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:45,530
Don't ask me that.

219
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,751
I know you can figure out the answer yourself.

220
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,350
Idiot!

221
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,351
He should've stayed home and let us handle it!

222
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:14,122
He didn't have to suffer this pointless loss!

223
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,063
<i>He': following me...</i>

224
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,699
<i>ma! the same distance.</i>

225
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,480
<i>Amazing! He picked up more
speed after losing the lead.</i>

226
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,342
Usually, the corner exit
is the key for a turbo car

227
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,514
while it's the corner entrance for an NA.

228
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:12,515
To put it simply, that's the
theory of downhill racing.

229
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,119
But with the misfiring system...

230
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,192
Right.The misfiring system makes

231
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,193
both the Turbo's torque and
the NA's response possible.

232
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,365
With Kyoichi': abilities,

233
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,366
that Evo Ill becomes a
monstrous cornering machine.

234
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,370
It can superbly enter and exit a corner.

235
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,563
It's perfect for a dogfight.

236
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,878
Like I said, this race was suicide!

237
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,879
From the get-go, this race
was never about speed.

238
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,483
What'!

239
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,389
Think about it.

240
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,390
Kyoichi has carefully studied this course,

241
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,560
while Takumi Fujiwara has no experience here.

242
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:01,063
There's no question who the favorite is.

243
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,496
Right.

244
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,269
I don't know what went on between them,

245
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,440
but Fujiwara showed up

246
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,441
without the tools to win this race.

247
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,078
But why did he have to be so irrational?

248
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,549
Only he understands that.

249
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,720
Sometimes we want t0 race

250
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,411
to blow off some frustration within us.

251
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,416
He had that air about him.

252
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:38,903
This isn't his normal racing style.

253
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,274
The Eight-Six's high-pitched
exhaust sounds <i>like...</i>

254
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,204
...an enraged roar.

255
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,378
<i>Whenever I turned around</i>

256
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,283
<i>There was always that
unchanging smile of yours</i>

257
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,554
<i>It was there on days when
I was too tired to go on</i>

258
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,226
<i>And even on days with a little happiness in them</i>

259
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:46,035
<i>My hands aren't enough</i>

260
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:57,850
<i>To hold on to all the love you gave me</i>

261
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,719
<i>The warm wind</i>

262
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,859
<i>Comes back quietly and tenderly</i>

263
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,534
<i>And as I gaze at the sky alone</i>

264
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,542
<i>You smile down upon me</i>

265
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,782
<i>You are still waving to me from the radiant light</i>

266
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:48,390
<i>Just like you did that day</i>

267
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:56,380
<i>You are my everlasting memory</i>

268
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:06,050
<i>Takumi gave up the lead.</i>

269
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,051
<i>Can he ever regain the lead, and...?</i>

270
00:23:09,921 --> 00:23:12,490
<i>Next on initial D: Second Stage...</i>

271
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,991
<i>"Goodbye Eight-Six."</i>

272
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,452
<i>Don'! miss it!</i>
