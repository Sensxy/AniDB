you her phone number?!

Am I supposed to believe that'!

47
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,244
What's the catch, really?

48
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,247
Really, lketani!

49
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,782
The world isn't that simple!

50
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,293

51
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,121
Racers don't need girls!

00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,758
Besides, if there': no catch, it's not like you.

53
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,699
What do you mean by that, Kenji'!

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,702
Are you putting me down'!

55
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,702
No, but it sounds too good to be true.

56
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,007
I hate seeing you jealous of my happiness.

57
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,679
Her long brown hair waving in the wind

58
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,116
and her seductive eyes glancing at me.

59
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:17,153
I'm positive God sent me this beautiful angel

60
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:20,156
because I'm an honest, hardworking man!

61
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:26,428
I'm off to Karuizawa tomorrow to see Mako.

62
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,503
Well, back to work!

63
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:36,906
Hey, why don't we follow
him and check her out'!

64
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,745
Good idea!

65
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,746
I wanna see her with my own eyes.

66
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,982
But what if lketani finds out'!

67
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:47,920
Bomtw
any.

68
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,920
He's lost in a fantasy world right now.

69
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,491
Let's go see what she really looks like,

70
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,229
this angelic Mako.

71
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,898
Hey, leave lketani alone.

72
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,734
We won't bother him.

73
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,734
When she dumps him, we'll cry with him.

74
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,672
That's friendship!

75
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:08,953
When she dumps him'!

76
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,031
I doubt she's as pretty as he says she is.

77
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,869
He exaggerate: everything.

78
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,870
--He gets obsessed, too.
"Right.

79
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,040
I think we were in junior high

80
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,210
when we went fishing at Akina Lake.

81
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:49,248
The fish weren't biting,

82
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,248
but I managed to catch a
small one right before we left.

83
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,885
He was, like, "Wow, it's huge!"

84
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,224
He went crazy.

85
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,326
It was this big.

86
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,326
People came to take a look at it.

87
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:06,663
I was so embarrassed.

88
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,834
He exaggerates.That's how he is.

89
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,142
Kenji, look to your left.

90
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,411
Crap!

91
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,411
I was lost in the story and
didn't realize I'd sped up.

92
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,415
So much for tailing him.

93
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,920
Sorry, lketani!

94
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,421
Forgive us!

95
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,324
We just wanted to see what she looked like.

96
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,826
Seriously!

97
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:36,762
We had no intention of bothering you two.

98
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,197
Don't be mad, okay'!

99
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:41,197
We'll turn around at the next interchange.

100
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,501
Oh, man.You don't have to go home.

101
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:47,804
I don't mind introducing you to her.

102
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,210
--You sure'!
--All right!

103
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,878
<i>But...</i>

104
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,013
...don't follow us after that,

105
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,849
or I'll be really mad!

106
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,650
Cool!

107
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,651
Anyway...

108
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:04,781
...these are my friends.

109
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,002
Hi, I'm Mako Sato.

110
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:17,867
--Hi...
--Hello.

111
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,677
--S ha ll we, Ma ko?
--Yeah.

112
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:29,982
Shoo, shoo!

113
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,612
We're not dogs.

114
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,861
This isn't a dream.

115
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,730
Unbelievable.

116
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,731
It's shocking to see lketani
with such a pretty girl...

117
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,737
Racers don't need girls.

118
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,373
Let's cry together, Kenji.

119
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,408
What'!

120
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,211
Are you saying that I can't find a girlfriend?!

121
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,672
It's just a joke!

122
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,449
What should we do now'!

123
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,953
Well, during this season,

124
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,857
Karuizawa isn't the place
for three guys to hang out.

125
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,335
Shall we go to Usui Pass'!

126
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,083
Sorry...

127
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:41,084
So, what kind of cars do you like'!

128
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,556
I liked, uh...

129
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,557
I admired the last generation RX-7.

130
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,163
An FC!

131
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,233
Hey, you have good taste.

132
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,668
You're a racer, aren't you'!

133
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:02,005
Oh, um, is it that obvious?

134
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:06,502
Normally, I try to drive like everyone else.

135
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,681
<i>So, Make, what do you think of street racers'!?</i>

136
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,655
They're okay. I like cars myself.

137
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,659
You do?!

138
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,461
Street racers usually have

139
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,462
better skills than normal drivers.

140
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,300
You can buy expensive cars with money,

141
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,304
but you can't buy technique.

142
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:35,305
I have much more respect for
those with good driving technique

143
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:39,008
than for those with fancy imports.

144
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:45,644
<i>She': a good girl... an ideal girl!</i>

145
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,327
So,this is Usui Pass.

146
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,662
I've never been here,

147
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,663
but it's much curvier than I had imagined.

148
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,169
It looks tough.

149
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,170
One corner after another,
and the road is narrow.

150
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,837
It doesn't look anything like Akina Pass.

151
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:17,062
I wonder who the fastest is here at Usui Pass'!

152
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:22,687
Um, lketani'!

153
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:25,256
Yes;

154
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,257
How would you feel about a girl
who liked to drive the passes

155
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,712
and acted like a street racer'!

156
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,771
--A Sileighty?!
--Yes.

157
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:42,540
They say a blue Sileighty is the fastest now.

158
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,541
And surprisingly, its driver is a woman.

159
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,412
A woman?!

160
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:52,548
--A <i>female racer...
--Yes...</i>

161
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,352
I'm totally okay with it, really.

162
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:59,856
As a matter of fact, I'd feel more
comfortable if she were a racer.

163
00:11:01,027 --> 00:11:03,027
"Really?
--Yeah.

164
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,298
<i>Now! get it.</i>

165
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:09,934
<i>She wants to be a racer,</i>

166
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,935
<i>which is why she likes an FC.</i>

167
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,874
A Sileighty with a woman driver.

168
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:18,043
A Sileightym?

169
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,645
--Is that an import'!
--No.

170
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,646
It's a 180 with a Silvia front end on it.

171
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:29,034
Silvia and 180, so "Sileighty."

172
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,756
Its driver is the fastest at Usui Pass,

173
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,262
and is a woman.

174
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,264
I gotta see that!

175
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:41,264
You can see her there at night, usually.

176
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,901
It's not wise to challenge her, though.

177
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:48,124
No locals even come close to her.

178
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,959
It's called Akina Speed Stars.

179
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,528
I built the team.

180
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,529
We have a young racer who they say

181
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,634
is the fastest at Akina Pass.

182
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,634
Speed-wise, I'd say I'm right behind him.

183
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,673
What's wrong, Mako'!

184
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,008
No, it's nothing.

185
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,009
Sorry, I must be boring you with my car talk.

186
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,982
No, it's not that.

187
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,983
I love cars, too, so it's fun.

188
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,250
Really? I'm glad.

189
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,525
So, do you also admire great
drifting skills and all that'!

190
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,464
Sure.

191
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,465
You need a lot of experience, like I have,

192
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:51,570
to use that technique, though.

193
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,472
It's dangerous.

194
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,075
So, you're good at drifting?

195
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,076
--Sure.
--I'm happy for you!

196
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,713
Yeah'!

197
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,999
Thank you for a wonderful day.

198
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,393
<i>--So, Make...
“Yes”!</i>

199
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,863
Well, I'm wondering if you have...

200
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,567
...you know, SOMEONE...

201
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,454
...you're seeing right now.

202
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:32,338
I don't have a boyfriend.

203
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,979
So, call me again, lketani.

204
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,985
<i>Wow,!</i>

205
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,693
Can you hear me, lketani'!

206
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,590
Wake up, lketani.

207
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,301
Um, I'm...

208
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,272
Why are you here?!

209
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:03,272
We couldn't go back, 'cause
we were worried about you.

210
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,096
So, how did it go'!

211
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,582
Today was a fine day, indeed.

212
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:15,651
You hungry? Dinner': on me!

213
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,655
We can also check out

214
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:21,593
the racers at Usui Pass.

215
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:24,594
It sounds like it went well.

216
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,350
I guess miracles do happen.

217
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,004
--Wow!
--They're good.

218
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,725
Every driver here has good skills.

219
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,345
Hey,Takumi'!

220
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:43,346
You've never been to other passes, right'!

221
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,250
How was it'!

222
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,251
Well, I mean, I wasn't the one driving,

223
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:51,757
so I really can't say.

224
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:54,757
Are you sure'! Your eyes were pretty serious.

225
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,495
Yeah'!

226
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,831
They look totally different now,

227
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:02,000
as if you're a different person.

228
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,836
Could you race here'!

229
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,836
I wouldn't know until I tried it.

230
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,649
--There!
--The Sileighty?!

231
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,131
"Continuous reverse drift!
--What the...'!!

232
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,691
<i>She': good!</i>

233
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:30,062
--Did you see that'!
--The narrow road made it intense!

234
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,530
<i>I told Mako that I was good at drifting,</i>

235
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,734
<i>but I still panic when the rear slides out.</i>

236
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:43,005
<i>I seriously have to work at it,</i>

237
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,510
<i>or H! lose my angel!</i>

238
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:48,511
--Let's head down.
--Yeah, okay.

239
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,650
Every pass has a great racer.

240
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:07,997
He's going pretty fast, isn't he'!

241
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,369
We got three people here.

242
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,837
I can't keep up.

243
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,272
We'd better give him some room.

244
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,175
He seems out of sync,

245
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,577
and his car's acting weird.

246
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,746
How can you tell'!

247
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:24,747
I'm not positive, but that's
probably what's going on.

248
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,050
Probably?

249
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,393
He spun out!

250
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,394
Takumi was right.

251
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,005
Crap! A car's coming!

252
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,744
That was close!

253
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,380
Who is this idiot?!

254
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:58,381
As the rear slides out, he panics
and spins out of control.

255
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,817
It's a beginner's mistake.

256
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,122
Hey,S13!

257
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,123
Move out of the way, or you'll
put other drivers in danger!

258
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,227
I'm moving...

259
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,498
That's so embarrassing!

260
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,129
Let's act like we don't know him.

261
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,523
Sorry about that...

262
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,423
What's wrong'!

263
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:42,359
Nothing.

264
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:54,591
<i>So, it': Make whose Sileighty
is the fastest at Usui Pass.</i>

265
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,699
<i>I wanna die!</i>

266
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,315
--A day off'!
--He hasn't called, either.

267
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,718
This is very rare for a workaholic like lketani.

268
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:14,123
He must've taken it real hard.

269
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,393
He didn't say a word after
what happened last night.

270
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,298
At a rest area on the way back,

271
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,733
his eyes were dull from shock.

272
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,734
I felt too bad to say anything to him.

273
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,173
I had a bad feeling about this.

274
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:32,174
She was too cute to be his girlfriend.

275
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:35,377
Like I said, racers don't need girls.

276
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:38,414
Itsuki the Lonely Driver... that's my title.

277
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,591
I hope he'll snap out of it soon.

278
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,763
Telephone, Koichiro!

279
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,534
Tell them I'm sleeping...

280
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,535
It's probably Kenji.

281
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:03,078
It's a girl named Mako Sato!

282
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,853
Did you want to talk to me'!

283
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,288
<i>Yeah...</i>

284
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:20,289
If you're here to make fun of me, please don't.

285
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:24,059
No, I'm not here to make fun of you.

286
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:28,027
I never suspected it was you.

287
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,302
I saw your Sileighty drift
through the narrow road.

288
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,682
The fastest at Usui Pass...

289
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:43,746
You could've warned me about that.

290
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,152
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:49,654
I've never told anyone about this.

292
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,890
It was shocking to me, too,

293
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,890
and I realized that I owed you the truth.

294
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,061
The truth?

295
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,098
I'm really the quiet type.

296
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,170
It's hard to believe that a quiet type

297
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,940
could drift that dynamically.

298
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:11,941
I'm one of those people whose
character changes behind the wheel.

299
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,283
No matter how fast I drive,

300
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,283
men don't see me as girlfriend material,

301
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,460
so I've decided to put an end to this.

302
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:31,186
I'm quitting racing after this summer.

303
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,166
To make this summer memorable,

304
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:38,167
I would like to race
Akina': Eight-Six at Usui Pass.

305
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,605
Wham'!

306
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,608
That's my wish.

307
00:20:42,608 --> 00:20:45,608
In return for my wish...

308
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:50,172
...I'll give you my virginity.

309
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,683
Wait a minute! That's nonsense!

310
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,555
--Am I not good enough?
"That's not it.

311
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,857
He's my friend,

312
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,758
so I can't sell him out like that.

313
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,565
<i>I get it now.</i>

314
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,700
<i>Her true intention...</i>

315
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,700
<i>...was not me, but Takumi.</i>

316
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,705
<i>Otherwise, a pretty girl like her</i>

317
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:18,076
<i>wouldn't be interested in someone like me.</i>

318
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:24,583
I understand.

319
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,585
I'll do what I can.

320
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,585
"Really?
--Don't get me wrong, though.

321
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,088
I'm not doing this
because of your proposition.

322
00:21:34,693 --> 00:21:36,194
Iketani...

323
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:40,414
I just want to make your wish come true.

324
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,245
<i>It': okay...</i>

325
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,246
<i>"because for a short while,
I was falling for her.</i>

326
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,715
<i>I just want her to be happy.</i>

327
